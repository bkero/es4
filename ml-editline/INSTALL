Since ML-editline is a library, there's nothing to install, but this file
contains some build instructions.

ML-editline works as either a native Windows library, using only the Win32 API,
or a Unix or Cygwin library relying on the curses library. To build the native
Windows version, you need MinGW; otherwise most standard Unix setups (including
Cygwin) should be fine.

In all cases, look in the example/ directory for a simple example application
and example/Makefile for an example of how to build an application with
ML-editline. I hope that the file is pretty self-explanatory but please do email
me with questions, suggestions, or feedback:

NATIVE WINDOWS

From a MinGW/MSYS shell, run make using the example/Makefile. Note that since
the rxvt terminal isn't supported, you will need to test the program in a Cygwin
terminal or Windows console.

UNIX/CYGWIN

Run make using the example/Makefile.
