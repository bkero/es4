ML-editline is a Standard ML library for adding command-line editing
functionality to applications akin to GNU Readline. ML-editline does not link

permissive MIT license.

See the files in example/ for an example of how to write and build a program
that uses ml-editline.

Features:

- arrow keys
- emacs keybindings (currently hard-wired):
  * ctrl-a, ctrl-b, ctrl-d, ctrl-e, ctrl-f, ctrl-k, ctrl-n, ctrl-p, ctrl-y
  * meta-backspace, meta-b, meta-d, meta-f
- EOF (on empty input): ctrl-d, ctrl-z (native Windows only)
- Unix signals (all platforms but native Windows): ctrl-c (SIGINT), ctrl-z (SIGSTOP)

Platforms:

- Cygwin, native Windows console, Linux, MacOS X
- quite possibly others

Terminals:

- native Windows console
- xterm, xterm-color, vt100, cygwin
- quite possibly others

Known bugs and limitations:

- resizing console window currently wreaks havoc
- suspending (SIGSTOP) and restoring (SIGCONT) a process
  does not redraw the current prompt and input
- rxvt support appears to be hopeless, at least in Windows

To do:

- audit all uses of flush
- bell e.g. when attempting to fall off the end the line
- transpose (ctrl-t, alt-t)
- undo (ctrl-/)
- transform case (alt-c, alt-l, alt-u)
- API for merging top history entries
- optimize refresh logic to avoid unnecessary redrawing

Long term wishes:

- .inputrc support
- history commands (see GNU History)
