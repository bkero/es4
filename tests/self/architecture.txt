Overall description of ESC / architecture notes.


Language and other constraints.

ESC is implemented in a subset of ES4 that will run on the AVM2 (as
shipped with FP9), and it will generate code for that same AVM2 --
thus it can self-compile.

The ES4 subset is as follows (note, this list also serves as a spec
for ASC updates, so it needs to be complete):

  * Anything that is handled by the parser by rewriting:
     - destructuring
     - use default namespace X
     - toplevel namespaces
     - switch type
  * Let statement forms (let-as-better-var)
  * Let-block (rewrites as let-as-better-var
  * "String", "Number" primitive types (as opposed to "string", "number"),
    though in general try to avoid using primitive type names whenever
    possible.


Front end.

The front end has the following parts:

  - Lexer takes a stream of characters and produces a stream of tokens
  - Parser takes a stream of tokens and produces an AST (see ast.es)
  - Definer takes an AST and produces an AST elaborated with Fixtures
  - Verifier takes an AST and, with the help of the backend, produces 
    an ABC byte stream

Some of the more important functions are each part of the front-end
include:

Lexer
  - Translate character escapes
  - Handle lexing modes (SlashRegExp & SlashDiv)

Parser
  - Desugar destructuring patterns
  - Construct initial AST

Definer
  - Resolve namespace attributes, pragma arguments, configuration
    expressions, extends and implements references
  - Construct fixtures for definitions

Verifier
  - Evaluate type expressions
  - Check overrides
  - Fold constants and other lightweight optimizations
  - Verify static type rules (strict mode)
  - Drive backend code generation


Back end.

The back end has the following levels, top to bottom:

  - AST consumer (cogen.es, emitter.es)
  - instruction macros, pasteup, temps, ... (assembler.es)
  - ABC data structure emitters (abcfile.es)
  - byte-stream abstraction (bytestream.es)

AST consumers call the assembler to emit instructions and data
directives; the assembler interacts with the ABCFile and
ABCConstantPool abstractions to build in-memory data structures that
can be serialized; those abstractions use the ABCByteStream to produce
correct decodings.

The final byte array representing the ABCFile is obtained by calling
getBytes() on the ABCFile instance; this byte stream is in some
platform dependent format (currently flash.utils.ByteArray).
