Overall description of ESC / architecture notes.

Front end.

TBW.


Back end.

The back end has the following levels, top to bottom:

  - AST consumer (emitter.es)
  - instruction macros, pasteup, constants (assembler.es)
  - ABC data structure emitters (abcfile.es, constantpool.es)
  - byte-stream abstraction (bytestream.es)

ABC consumers call the assembler to emit instructions and data
directives; the assembler interacts with the ABCFile and
ABCConstantPool abstractions to build in-memory data structures that
can be serialized; those abstractions use the ABCByteStream to produce
correct decodings.

The final byte array representing the ABCFile is obtained by calling
getBytes() on the ABCFile instance; this byte stream is in some
platform dependent format (currently flash.utils.ByteArray).
