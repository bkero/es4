This is the SML/NJ Library.  It is free software distributed under the SML/NJ
system's license (see the LICENSE file for details).

The library is organized as a collection of CM libraries. Here is a roadmap of
the library structure:

  Directory	Sources File		Description
  -------------------------------------------------
  Util		smlnj-lib.cm		This is the general utility library.

  Controls	controls-lib.cm		This is a library of support code
					for managing application controls.

  HashCons	hash-cons-lib.cm	This is a library supporting hash-consing
					of data structures and efficient sets and
					maps using hash-consed keys.

  HTML		html-lib.cm		This library provides parsing and pretty
					printing of HTML (Version 3.2).

  INet		inet-lib.cm		Networking utilities (for both Unix
					and Windows).

  PP		pp-lib.cm		Pretty-printing library.

  Reactive	reactive-lib.cm		A low-level reactive scripting library.

  RegExp	regexp-lib.cm		Regular-expression library.

  Unix		unix-lib.cm		Unix specific utilities.

The first column is the source directory, the second gives the library sources
file alias (to be used in your application's sources.cm file), and the third
column gives a brief description.  Look at the Doc dicrectory and at the README
files in the individual subdirectories for more documentation.
