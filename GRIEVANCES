 - opening two modules that introduce colliding names should be an error or 
   at least a warning

 - an operator/operand mismatch occurs between two record types that
   have N correctly unifying fields and M non-unifying fields should
   hilight the non-unifying fields in some fashion (currently you 
   have to eyeball it, which is painful on large fields)

 - error messages should demonstrate the source context by
   "ASCII-underlining" or ocaml-like highlighting

 - you should be able to declare a top-level function type, not just inline

 - type inference messages are nigh-useless (okay, fine, open research
   problem)
