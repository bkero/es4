 - opening two modules that introduce colliding names should be an error or 
   at least a warning

 - an operator/operand mismatch occurs between two record types that
   have N correctly unifying fields and M non-unifying fields should
   hilight the non-unifying fields in some fashion (currently you 
   have to eyeball it, which is painful on large fields)
