Tips and tricks for using SML/NJ effectively

 - You can have a built-in library autoloaded at the REPL by passing it
   as an argument to the `sml' command, using the same name as you would
   use in your own .cm file. For example, to autoload the pretty-printing
   library, where your .cm file would include $/pp-lib.cm, just use:

     % sml '$/pp-lib.cm'
