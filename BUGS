  Incorrect namespace sets for property lookup.  Consider code in the
  Array package:

        public static function join(self, sep = undefined)
           ...

        prototype function join(sep = undefined)
            Array.join(this, sep);

        intrinsic function join(sep = undefined):String
            Array.join(this, sep);

  Here the "Array." qualification is currently necessary, but it should not
  be, because statics should be visible and should not be shadowed by instance
  methods (I think).

  The arguments object is wrong.  It can't be an Array object, it
  needs to be an Object that delegates to the Array prototype.  This
  is important because the "length" field must always be the actual
  number of arguments passed, not taking into account defaults or rest
  args.  Thus initializing it from the instantiated formal argument
  list is not at all correct.

  Also, the arguments object must appear to share storage with its
  activation record, this can be handled by instantiating it with
  scoped getters and setters when it is created (and this is a good
  specification mechanism, probably).
