Binary Installation

The binary release consists of a single directory es4/ with several
files. As long as you keep all these files together in one directory,
you may move that directory anywhere (and/or rename it).

Cygwin
------

Run the interpreter with the es4 script.

Type :help at the ES4 prompt for information about the interpreter.

Windows
-------

On Windows without Cygwin, run the es4.bat batch file.

Type :help at the ES4 prompt for information about the interpreter.

GNU LIBC 2.3.
