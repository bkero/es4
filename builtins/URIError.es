 * E262-4 draft (intrinsic functions)
 *
 * Status: Incomplete; Not reviewed against spec; Not tested.
 *
 * To check:
 *
 * Can we use "prototype" with "var" like I do here?  It makes sense,
 * and is desirable, but probably not necessary.
 *
 * It's my belief that making eg EvalError extend Error makes
 * EvalError.prototype be an Error object, though that needs to be
 * verified.
