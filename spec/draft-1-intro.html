<h1>Proposed ECMAScript 4th Edition Specification<br>Draft 1</h1>
<div>16 May 2008</div>
</center>

<P> The Proposed ECMAScript 4th Edition (ES4) Specification is divided
into roughly four components:

<DL>

<DT> Syntax
<DD> Concrete syntax and translation into abstract syntax

<DT> Core semantics
<DD> Values and storage, types, scopes, name resolution, and name lookup

<DT> Computation
<DD> Loading, definition and binding, expressions, and statements

<DT> Libraries
<DD> Pre-defined data types, objects, functions, and constants

</DL>

<P> The present draft is incomplete.  It includes the grammar for the
concrete syntax and the entire second component, the core semantics.

<P> As this is the first draft, there are some redundancies among the
chapters, some background information may be absent, there are some
rough parts in the formal specifications, and there is a fair amount
of nonuniformity in the notation used.

<P> The editors anticipate delivering future drafts to TC39 about two
weeks before every scheduled TC meeting.  In the interval between TC
meetings drafts of parts of the other components ("speclets") are
being circulated and debated on the ES4 discussion list [1].

<P> Familiarity with ECMAScript 3rd Edition (ES3) Specification is
required to understand the present draft.

<h2>Specification Formalism</h2>

<P> The ES4 specification makes use of the following formalisms.

<DL>
<DT> Syntax

<DD> The surface syntax is specified using a context-free grammar
formalism similar to those used to specify ES3, C, C++, Java, and C#.

<P> The surface syntax is mapped to abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
Some syntactic forms are desugared into core forms in this mapping.
For example, destructuring bindings are desugared into a combination
of simple bindings, temporary variables, and assignment expressions.
ASTs represent only the core forms of the language.

<DT> Core semantics and computation

<DD> The semantics of the AST form of the language are expressed in
terms of operations on the ASTs and on additional structures that
represent ECMAScript values, semantic (primitive) values, and
metadata.  The operations as well as all the data structures for ASTs,
ECMAScript values, semantics values, and metadata are expressed in the
language Standard&nbsp;ML&nbsp;[2].

<DT> Libraries

<DD> The semantics of the pre-defined types, objects, functions, and
constants are expressed largely in terms of ES4 code operating on ES4
data structures (whose meaning in turn is given by the definitions of
the ES4 syntax and core semantics).

</DL>

<P> The bulk of the ES4 specification consists of normative prose.
The Standard&nbsp;ML code and the ES4&nbsp;fragments are used to
specify precisely certain aspects of the language only, namely all
those that were described by informal pseudocode in the ES3 spec, some
that were described only by prose in the ES3 spec, and some that are
new to ES4 (such as the type system).

<P> There are three significant reasons why we use Standard&nbsp;ML
and ES4 instead of pseudocode.  First, these are well-defined
languages with significantly greater expressiveness than the low-level
pseudocode.  Second, as they are real programming languages, the
specification fragments can be checked by machine, given a surrounding
test infrastructure.  Finally, with care, code can be excerpted
directly from the test harness into the specification document.

<P> Over the course of the past year, members of the ES4 working group
have been writing just such a testbed--a complete reference
implementation of ES4.  The Standard&nbsp;ML and ES4 fragments in this
specification have--with very few exceptions--been excerpted from that
reference implementation, thereby removing a source of error in the
specification.

<P> A real danger with using a live implementation for specification
purposes is overspecification.  Some care has been taken to abstract
the implementation away from those details that we do not wish to
specify.  In the case of the libraries, this strategy has been very
successful; in the case of the core language, there is probably more
work to be done.  But there is no indication at this point that it
cannot be done.  We also note that the ES3 Specification is very
detailed and that there is only a small difference in specificity
between most pseudocode fragments of the ES3 Specification and the
corresponding Standard&nbsp;ML fragments of the ES4 specification.

<P> A final note about the terms "semantic" and "semantics" as used in
the core language specification: they invariably mean "at the level of
Standard&nbsp;ML".

<h2>The Themes of ES4</h2>

<P> The central themes in the design of ES4 have been the following.

<DL>

<DT> Compatibility with ES3; interoperation between ES3 and ES4

<DD> Compatibility with ES3 cannot be sacrificed except in situations
where compatibility does not make a practical difference, where
existing implementations differ or a <em>de facto</em> standard has
evolved, or where compatibility would fatally imperil other goals.
Therefore, one central goal of the work has been that ES4
implementations should run all existing ES3 programs and that ES3 and
ES4 code should be able to be intermixed in a single global
environment.  (The ES4 working group has released a paper&nbsp;[4]
examining the compatibility between ES3 and ES4.)

<DT> Programming in the large

<DD> The largest ECMAScript programs are significantly larger in 2008
than they were in 1999, when the ES3 Specification was released, and
ES4 must provide improved facilities for encapsulation, consistency,
error checking, and library building.

<DT> Program evolution

<DD> While ES is increasingly being used for large programs, it is
still being used for small scripts and for programs that start small
but evolve over time to become large.  ES4 must provide support for
program evolution.

<DT> Convenience features

<DD> Conveniences help make a language more useful (they hide tedious
detail).  The conveniences expected by programmers change over time,
as new patterns and ideas make it into the mainstream or supplant
other ideas; ES4 should not fight this but should incorporate patterns
and ideas from other languages if appropriate and possible.

<DT> Bug fixes

<DD> Not all designs work out as expected.  For example, the stripping
of Unicode format control characters specified by ES3 annoys
programmers who like to embed those characters in literal strings and
regular expressions, where they are required either for proper
formatting on output or to properly match input.  If an incompatible
change to the language that repairs a design bug is likely to fix
significantly more programs than it breaks, then the change should be
considered for ES4.

<DT> Self-hosting

<DD> On the principle that what is good for the language is good for
its users, it is a goal that the bulk of the pre-defined libraries
(data types, functions, objects, and constants) should be expressible
in ES4.  For example, while ES3 does not provide a class abstraction
the pre-defined objects of ES3 are most easily expressed in class
terms, and classes and interfaces proliferate in host object models
for ES3.  For those reasons (and others), classes are a candidate
feature for ES4.

</DL>

<h2>A Brief Overview of ES4 Facilities</h2>

<P> In October 2007 the ES4 working group released a paper&nbsp;[5]
outlining the feature space of ES4.  Since that time a significant
number of proposed features have been removed from the language; yet
others have been streamlined or generalized.  The most significant
facilities remaining in the draft language are the following.

<DL>

<DT> Namespaces

<DD> Namespaces are values that serve as tags on names; they help to
segregate the names of independently developed subprograms, they aid
versioning, and they make it possible to control access to properties.


<DT> Types and type constraints

<DD> Classes in the style of Java and (non-recursive) structural
record and array types are provided as more reliable alternatives to
ES3 constructor functions.  The advantage of classes and the
structural types is that they <em>fix</em> object properties, thereby
providing programs with greater integrity against accidental or
malicious changes.

<P> Bound variables and fixed object properties can be
<em>annotated</em> with types.  The annotations place constraints on
the variables and properties, which can only be updated with values
conforming to the type constraint.

<P> Crucially, type annotations are always optional; the programmer
adds type annotations on an as-needed basis.  This results in a type
system that is <em>gradual</em>.

<P> The type system is complemented with interface types in the style
of Java and with union types that provide a kind of <em>post hoc</em>
interfaces.

<P> Finally, types can be aliased, and both type aliases and class and
interface definitions can be parameterized.


<DT> Creature comforts 

<DD> ES4 adds proper block scoping and constant bindings, new control
structures such as iterators and generators, and getters and setters
on objects.

<P> There also is a fair amount of new syntactic sugar, including
succinct function definitions and function expressions, destructuring
binding and assignment, and array comprehensions.


<DT> Upgraded libraries

<DD> The ES4 libraries add methods to objects inherited from ES3, and
provide new data types (such as homogenous vectors, maps, and decimal
floating point numbers), new top-level functions (such as object
identity hashing), and reflection facilities.

</DL>

<h2>Programs, Compilation Units, and Compilation Phases</h2>

<P> A complete ES4 program is comprised of a possibly unbounded linear
sequence of <em>compilation units</em> (each of which conforms to the
<em>Program</em> nonterminal in the grammar) that is loaded into a
<em>global environment</em>.  Each compilation unit may effect the
global environment by contributing definitions of new names to it or
by changing the values stored in it.  There may be multiple global
environments.  ES4 provides no mechanism by which code running in one
global environment can gain access to another global environment;
however, implementations of ES4 may provide such mechanisms, and the
ES4 Specification will occasionally address the meaning of code that
operates on multiple global environments.

<P> Compilation units pass through three phases: parsing, definition,
and evaluation.  Parsing and definition together transform the
compilation unit from source form into an AST form, in the process (a)
checking that the compilation uint conforms to the grammar and to
extra-grammatical, syntactic constraints, and (b) resolving names that
denote namespaces and types.  Evaluation performs the operations that
are specified by the resulting AST.
