Some issues / thoughts around the technology required for spec
production.


= Markup = 

It is the Right Thing to separate markup and formatting.  It is a Good
Thing to have text that can be diffed.  Thus latex, XML, or similar is
to be preferred for the source of the spec.  Word, Wiki, etc are
clearly inferior.

However, ECMA probably wants a Word doc, publication wants a PDF, and
the world wants HTML+CSS, so we must be able to produce those formats.
Can we?

If we choose XML+CSS:

  - We can produce PDF from XML+CSS using PrinceXML
  - XML+CSS is itself enough to format the doc for the web

  - But can we produce Word from either XML+CSS (or in the worst case
    from PDF)?


If we choose latex:

  - Can we produce Word from latex?
  - Can we produce PDF from latex?  (We can probably
    go latex -> dvi -> postscript -> pdf in the worst case.)


How bad is Word if we choose to just use that?

  - Some people can't read it (though OpenOffice is available); all
    drafts will be distributed as PDF

  - Diffs are probably not the easiest thing, don't know how we'd do
    versioning

  - Less easy to merge changes from multiple sources, probably.


= Code extraction =

- What has been done? (sync w/ Francis)

- What's it been done for (libraries or SML)?

- Library: probably enough to tag the source code with some bracketing, 
    //+tag
    ...
    //-tag
  and then reference "tag" from the text; some merge tool will do the
  rest.  (Inverted literate programming!)  Needs to undent, not hard.

  Tags should be unique in the file.

Facts about MS Word:

 - Template formatting (eg for NOTE sections, headers that are
   signatures): can MS Word read and process CSS reasonably?  

   It appears that it does process STYLE and applies some of it; I
   managed to apply a font-style on a <P> with a special class name.

HTML issues that are unresolved:

 - symbolic cross referencing: HTML has no facilities for this short
   of hyperlinks, which I guess translates to both Word and PDF but
   are no good for print documents.  No prepass can fix this; word
   needs to handle it somehow _after_ sections are numbered.  But how?
   The only thing I can think of is a fancier tool that does the
   numbering, so that word won't.

   Can CSS do that?  And if it can, what does word do?

   What does word do with "#name" links?
