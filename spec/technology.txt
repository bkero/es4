General information about how the spec is produced.


The spec is written as chunks of HTML4 (for the moment) with some
light CSS usage.  These chunks are processed by a script (stitch.py)
that stitches everything together to produce a single file.  See the
Makefile and comments in stitch.py for more information on the
technical side of things.

The HTML source files use some custom tags (INCLUDE, XREF) for
including other files as well as program fragments from the RI.  See
style.txt.  This is still pretty primitive, though it works.  More
will happen with custom tags.

The HTML source files can also use light wiki markup to reduce clutter,
see style.txt.

The complete file will then be read into MS Word, after which ECMA or
ISO templates will be applied and the desired Word document produced.

The Word document will also be printed to PDF for distribution.

All scripts and text are under source control in the monotone
repository.

HTML issues that are unresolved:

 - symbolic cross referencing: HTML has no facilities for this short
   of hyperlinks, which I guess translates to both Word and PDF but
   are no good for print documents.  No prepass can fix this; word
   needs to handle it somehow _after_ sections are numbered.  But how?
   The only thing I can think of is a fancier tool that does the
   numbering, so that word won't.

   Can CSS do that?  And if it can, what does word do?

   What does word do with "#name" links?
