<h1>Tutorial Introduction to the ES4 Library Draft</h1>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The ES4 library specification is expressed in terms of ES4
fragments: the specification uses executable -- and testable -- ES4
code in places where the ES3 specification uses pseudocode.  As a
consequence, the draft library specicifaction makes some assumptions
about what ES4 will look like when it is finished.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This guide contains an outline of some aspects of ES4 that it will
be useful or necessary for the readers of the draft specification to
know, beyond what is in ES3.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This guide will not be a part of the final ES4 specification.


<h2>Namespaces, names</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> ES4 places all names in namespaces.  A name is in exactly one
namespace and it is placed in that namespace by prefixing the binding
keyword for the name (<code>class</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>function</code>, and
others) with the namespace name.  If <code>MyNS</code> is a namespace then

<PRE>
    MyNS var x 
</PRE>

creates a variable whose fully qualified name is <code>MyNS::x</code>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> There are several pre-defined namespaces.  The namespace
<code>__ES4__</code> is used for all top-level names that are new to ES4 if
they're not in one of the other namespaces.  Important pre-defined
namespaces are <code>__ES4__::intrinsic</code> and <code>__ES4__::reflect</code>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> (Two new names are not in any of the new namespaces: <code>__ES4__</code>
and <code>__ECMASCRIPT_VERSION__</code>.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In order to avoid having to fully qualify names all the time,
namespaces can be <i>opened</i>; the names defined in the namespace will
then be available without qualificiation.  The namespace <code>__ES4__</code>
is opened for all ES4 code, so in practice the two pre-defined
namespaces listed above are known just as <code>intrinsic</code> and
<code>reflect</code>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Opening a namespace may introduce ambiguities, which can be
resolved by fully qualifying ambiguous names.  Ambiguities are not
common because a namespace opened in an inner lexical scope takes
precedence over namespaces opened in outer scopes.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>intrinsic</code> namespace is reserved; user code is not allowed
to introduce new names in this namespace.  The <code>intrinsic</code> namespace
is used primarily for methods in the pre-defined classes.  For every
prototype method <i>M</i> there is a corresponding intrinsic method <i>M</i>
in the class.  For example, there is <code>Array.prototype.concat</code> and
also an <code>intrinsic::concat</code> method on <code>Array</code> instances.  The
prototype methods are fully compatible with ES3 in the types they
accept and how they convert values.  The intrinsic methods normally
have more tightly constrained signatures and, like all class methods,
are immutable (though they can be overridden in subclasses -- that's
allowed even for user code).

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>intrinsic</code> namespace provides integrity (code that calls an
intrinsic method will know that it references the original method, it
is not at the mercy of changes to the prototype method) and
optimization opportunities (early binding to the slot that holds the
method in the presence of type annotations).  The specification of the
pre-defined classes in terms of ES4 code makes use of other
pre-defined classes and their methods, and pre-defined methods are
careful to call intrinsic methods to invoke known behavior and to call
public methods to invoke explicitly variant behavior.  Normally, such
invocations are always explicitly qualified in the text in order to
avoid any ambiguity in the reader's mind.


<h2>Types and annotations</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Bindings in ES4 are typed, and the type can be provided explicitly
in the definition of a binding by following the bingind's name with a
colon and the type:

<PRE>
    var x: Array
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the type is omitted, it is "*" (read as "any"), which means the
binding has no type constraint.  If we assume just run-time type
checking, then a check is performed every time a value is stored into
an annotated variable: the type of the value must be a subtype of the
annotated type.  Effectively, properties are subject to a write
barrier.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Functions can be annotated as well, in both their parameter and
return positions.  Annotations on parameters constrain how the
function can be called.  Annotations in the return position constrains
what the function can return:

<PRE>
    function f(x: string): RegExp { ... }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> There are two classes of types, nominal types and structural
types.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Nominal types are introduced by class definitions and interface
definitions.  Values of nominal types are created by instantiating
classes (using the "new" operator).  The syntax and semantics are
broadly as in Java: A nominal type is equal only to itself; a value is
of a class type only if it was instantiated from that type; and it is
of an interface type only if it was instantiated from a class type
that declares that it implements that interface.  (Unlike in Java, the
access control keywords such as <code>private</code> and <code>public</code> are
actually aliases for language-provided namespaces.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Methods on classes appear as function definitions in the class
body.  The class instance is in scope in the body of a method, as is
the class object (holding the static properties).

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Structural types are record types (for example <code>{x:int,y:int}</code>),
array types (for example <code>[int]</code>), tuple types (for example
<code>[int,string]</code>), union types (for example <code>(int|string|RegExp)</code>),
function types (for example <code>function(int):boolean)</code>, and some
special types (<code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>).  A structural type is
equal to any other structural type that has the same fields with the
same types (in any order), and a value is of a structural type if it
has fixed (non-deletable) fields with the names and types given by the
structural type.  (So if <code>Point</code> is a class with <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
integer fields, an instance of <code>Point</code> is of the structural type
<code>{x:int,y:int}</code>.)  Structural types can't be recursive.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Types can be given names by type definitions:

<PRE>
    type Num = (int|double)
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Type definitions, class definitions, and interface definitions can
be parameterized:

<PRE>
    class Map.&#60;K,V> { ... }
    type Box.&#60;T> = { value: T }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Record and array types are instantiated by suffixing the literal
with the type:

<PRE>
    { value: 7 } : Box.&#60;int>
    [1,2,3] : [int]
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Any type is a subtype of <code>*</code>, and <code>Box.<T></code> is a subtype of
<code>Box.<*></code>, for any T.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> One of the important aspecs of the type system is that the types
provide a specification for fixtures on the objects that are of the
type: in any value of type <code>Box.<T></code>, the <code>value</code> property can't be
removed.  (Instances of structural types can always have extra
non-fixture fields, as can instances of classes designated <code>dynamic</code>.)


<h2>Functions</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Functions can take optional arguments (they have default values)
and rest arguments:

<PRE>
    function f(x, y=0) { ... }   // y is optional
    function f(x, ...rest) { ... }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The rest argument appears as a regular <code>Array</code> object holding
the excess parameter values.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Function bodies that contain a simple return statement (which
typically returns the result of a call to another function) are
common; ES4 introduces a shorthand -- extensively used in the library
draft specifications -- where the body is a brace-less expression:

<PRE>
    function f(x, y)
      g(x*2, y, 0)
</PRE>


<h2>Informative and helper methods</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The library specification is normative, which means the ES4 code
in the specification is normative too.  In order to avoid
overspecification the specification factors out non-normative sections
as methods in the <code>informative</code> namespace.  The informative methods
are described by prose.  A good example is the global hashcode
function:

<PRE>
    intrinsic const function hashcode(o): double {
        switch type (o) {
        case (x: null)       { return 0 }
        case (x: undefined)  { return 0 }
        case (x: AnyBoolean) { return Number(x) }
        case (x: AnyNumber)  { return intrinsic::toUint(x) }
        case (x: AnyString)  { return informative::stringHash(x) }
        case (x: Namespace)  { return informative::namespaceHash(x) }
        case (x: Name)       { return informative::nameHash(x) }
        case (x: *)          { return informative::objectHash(x) }
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Hashing on <b>null</b>, <b>undefined</b>, booleans, and numbers are
normatively specified, but hashing on strings, names, namespaces, and
other objects are only informatively specified.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In order to share code, the specification also factors out
commonalities as methods in the <code>helper</code> namespace.  A common case
is where both prototype methods and intrinsic methods take a variable
number of arguments, as for the concat method in <code>Array</code>:

        prototype function concat(...items)
            Array.helper::concat(this, items);

        intrinsic function concat(...items): Array
            Array.helper::concat(this, items);

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> (In this case the <code>helper</code> function is a static method on the
<code>Array</code> class, because that accomodates the static <code>concat</code> method
too.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>private</code> namespace is used in a manner similar to the
<code>helper</code> namespace.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>helper</code> functions are normative in the sense that they
define the functionality of a method, eg in the order of operations on
a data structure.  But <code>helper</code> functions are not visible in a real
implementation, they are not part of the API, and a real
implementation does not reserve the <code>helper</code> namespace.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In a similar manner, the prose description for an <code>informative</code>
functions defines its functionality but leaves the implementation more
room for variations.  The <code>informative</code> functions are not visible in
a real implementation, they are not part of the API, and a real
implementation does not reserve the <code>implementation</code> namespace.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A final constraint on <code>informative</code> functions is that they do 
not call program-visible (i.e., public, protected, intrinsic, reflect, 
meta, iterator, or prototype) methods on their 'this' object except 
as explicitly specified in the specification.


<h2>Meta-level methods</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The pre-defined namespace "meta" is used for methods that
participate in language-level protocols: invocation, property access,
and property update.  A class that defines a <code>meta::invoke</code> fixture
is callable as a function (the <code>meta::invoke</code> method is invoked in
response to the call); the <code>meta::get</code>, <code>meta::set</code>,
<code>meta::has</code>, and <code>meta::delete</code> methods are invoked in response to
accesses to all dynamic (non-fixture) properties on the object, and
respectively read a property value, update a property, query the
existence of a property, and remove a property.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The meta methods have have static and instance forms.  This is
particularly prominent for <code>meta::invoke</code>.  Given a class <code>Cls</code>
with a static <code>meta::invoke</code> method:

<PRE>
    class Cls { 
        static meta function invoke(...)
        ... 
    }
</PRE>

you can call <code>Cls</code> as a function:

<PRE>
    x = y + Cls(z);
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This is used by many classes to implement converters to the class
type.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Given a class <code>Cls</code> with an instance <code>meta::invoke</code> method:

<PRE>
    class Cls {
        meta function invoke(...) ... 
    }
</PRE>

then it is the instances of <code>Cls</code> that are themselves callable:

<PRE>
    c = new Cls;
    x = y + c(z);
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This is used in some instances to make arbitrary objects callable,
and is used to model the fact that instances of Functions are
themselves callable as functions.


<h2>magic</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The specification makes use of a pre-defined namespace "magic".
This namespace is reserved in the specification but not in any actual
implementation of the language.  It is used only to tag top-level
functions that are implementation hooks.  The hooks provide
functionality that is not available in the language, for example,
accessing the internal <code>[[prototype]]</code> property of objects.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Magic functions are defined by prose for the moment; it is
probable that they will be (at least partly) exposed as Standard ML
fragments later, in the style of the semantic functions we're planning
for other parts of the specification.


<h2>Non-nullable types, primitive types</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Occasionally in the library draft specification you will see an
exclamation point added to the end of a type expression:

<PRE>
    class Namespace {
        static meta function invoke(x): Namespace! 
            ....
    }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The exclamation point indicates a "non-nullable reference", ie, in
this case that the value returned may never be <b>null</b>.  Similar
annotations are used for parameter types in some cases.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The primitive types of the language are the classes <code>string</code>,
<code>boolean</code>, and <code>double</code>.  These correspond to the primitive types
in ES3.  They are non-nullable types; that is, a function returning
<code>string</code> will never return **null*..
