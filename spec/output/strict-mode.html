<h2>Synopsis and background</h2>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The pragma "use strict" enables strict mode for code within the
scope of the pragma.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The pragma takes the form of either an ES4 pragma or a do-nothing
one-armed <code>if</code> statement:

<PRE>
    "use" "strict"
    "if" "(" "false" ")" "use" "(" "strict" ")"
</PRE>

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The second form of the "use strict" pragma is a concession to
ES3.1, because that form of the pragma is compatible with ES3 syntax.
It is not recommended for ES4 code.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> There are two ways the "use strict" pragma can be used, depending
on the context.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In one use, the pragma can occur at the outermost level of the
program, at the top level of a package block, or at the top level of
(arbitrarily nested) top-level blocks that are not dependents of
control flow statements.  In these cases, the scope of the pragma
extends from the end of the pragma until the end of the program, the
end of the package block, or the end of the top-level block, or until
a "use standard" pragma is encountered.  The "use standard" pragma
takes the form of either an ES4 pragma or a do-nothing one-armed
<code>if</code> statement:

<PRE>
    "use" "standard"
    "if" "(" "false" ")" "use" "(" "standard" ")"
</PRE>

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The "use standard" pragma is a concession to programs that
intermix standard and strict parts.  It is restricted to the top level
because ambiguities would result if it were to be used inside other
scopes.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In another use, the "use strict" pragma can occur inside any class
body, function body, or block that is the dependent of a control flow
statement.  In these cases, the pragma can be preceded in the body or
block only by other pragmas, and the "use standard" pragma is not
allowed.  In these cases, the scope of the pragma is the entire class,
function, or block, with all nested functions or blocks.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In the following, when the phrasing is used that a function or a
piece of code "is strict" then the meaning is that the scope of some
strict mode pragma includes the function or piece of code.


<h2>Run-time checks</h2>

<h3><code>this</code> never captures the global object</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In ES3, when a function is called "as a function" (that is, not as
a method on some receiver object -- the notion is not syntactic, but
can depend on the binding of the function) the value of <code>this</code>
passed to the function is <b>null</b>.  The callee (or the call protocol)
substitutes the callee's global object for the <b>null</b> value, so the
value of <code>this</code> observed in the callee is the callee's global
object.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the callee is strict, however, the <b>null</b> is not converted to
the callee's global object.  Instead, if the callee evaluates the
expression <code>this</code> when the value of <code>this</code> is <b>null</b> then a
<b>ReferenceError</b> is thrown.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  We want to make that more precise but the current prose
captures the intent well enough.

<h3>Writing to properties</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If an assignment expression that is strict would write to a
read-only property or variable then a <b>ReferenceError</b> is thrown.

<h3>Creating global variables</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If an assignment expression that is strict would create a new
property on the global object (regardless of whether the assignment is
to a variable or to a property on an object that turns out to be the
global object) then a <b>ReferenceError</b> is thrown.

<h3>Deleting properties</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a <code>delete</code> expression that is strict would delete a variable
or property that is a fixture or that is marked as not removable, then
a <b>ReferenceError</b> is thrown.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a <code>delete</code> expression that is strict would delete a variable
that is not in scope or a property that is not an own property on the
object from which it were to be deleted, then a <b>ReferenceError</b> is
thrown.

<h3>Arity checking</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a function that is strict is called with fewer or more
arguments than it expects then a <b>TypeError</b> is thrown.

<h3><code>arguments</code></h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a function is strict then its <code>arguments</code> object does not
share storage with the formal parameters of the function, and those
properties of the <code>arguments</code> object that correspond to the formal
parameters, as well as the <code>length</code> property of the <code>arguments</code>
object, are neither writeable nor removable.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a function is strict and the implementation supports the ES1
style <code>FunctionObject.arguments</code> facility, then a <b>ReferenceError</b>
is thrown if the <code>arguments</code> property is accessed on any instance of
the function.

<h3><code>eval</code></h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the eval operator is strict and attempts to introduce a new
binding into its inherited variable binding object then a
<b>ReferenceError</b> is thrown (even if that binding object is the
global object).

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the eval operator is strict then the program it evaluates is
also strict.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The global <code>eval</code> function is not strict.


<h2>Compile-time checks</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A <b>SyntaxError</b> is thrown if any of the following conditions are
violated.

<h3><code>with</code></h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A <code>with</code> statement cannot be strict.

<h3>Names</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A strict function cannot have duplicate parameter names.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A strict function cannot bind a name by <code>var</code> or by a top-level
function definition if that name is also the name of a parameter to
the function or the name <code>arguments</code>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A strict function cannot bind a name more than once by <code>var</code> or
by a top-level function definition.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Duplicate definitions of names by <code>function</code>, <code>const</code>, or
<code>let</code> inside a block is already illegal in the language (I hope).

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Strict object initializers cannot have duplicate property names.


<h2>Candidates for inclusion</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> I'm uncertain about the following because they require levels of
analysis that I don't want to burden lightweight implementations with.
I believe they fit in better with an optional verifier (part of a tool
chain).  Lightweight variants can be defined but it's unclear how
valuable those would be.


<h3>Reference before definition</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> (Heavyweight variant) In a strict function it is a static error if
the compiler cannot prove, by definite assignment analysis for
example, that a variable has always been initialized at every point
where it is referenced.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> (Lightweight variant) In a strict function it is a static error if
the compiler can prove, by simple forward attribute propagation for
example, that a variable is never initialized at some point when it is
referenced.  Consider for example this:

<PRE>
     function f(y) {
         let x;
         if (y == 1)
             return x;    // clear error
         return x;        // clear error
         while (true) {   // backward edge kills analysis
           if (y == 1)
             return x;    // not an error
         }
     }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In my opinion the heavyweight variant should not be mandated and
the lightweight variant is not very interesting, but it can be
interesting to discuss it.


<h3>Effect-free statements</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Provably effect-free statements cannot occur in strict code.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> There is a simple and fairly lightweight analysis here based on
attribute synthesis in expressions: constants and references to
variables and fields that are known not to invoke getters are
effect-free; the results of primitive operations on useless values are
effect-free (provided the types are known so that conversions can be
taken into account); if an expression statement has an effect-free
expression then the statement is effect-free and illegal.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Again it's unclear how useful this is and whether it's not better
considered as a part of a verifier.


<h2>Partial rationale</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In a number of cases the utility of the strict mode restrictions
should be self-evident and won't be justified here.  In some cases it
is not.


<h3><code>this</code> never captures the global object</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The utility of this is that functions don't gain access to the
global object accidentally.  Since functions can't introduce new
bindings in the global object in strict mode the restriction is more
defense-in-depth than anything (after all, in ES4 the global object is
available through the global variable <code>global</code>).

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Standard mode in ES4 and ES3.1 might already end up throwing an
exception on access to <code>this</code> if the function was called as a
function; that has yet to be settled.  However, that kind of a change
is a real compatibility hazard, and allowing the program to opt in to
the change by asking for strict mode is better.


<h3><code>arguments</code></h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The utility of making the arguments object read-only is that the
aliasing with the formal parameters is unlikely to be desirable as
the common case.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The utility of making access to <code>FunctionObject.arguments</code> throw
an exception is that the mechanism, if unchecked, allows arbitrary
functions to look at and modify the <code>arguments</code> and formal
parameters of active methods.  This is a privacy and security problem.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The change that makes the arguments object read-only fixes the
problem where arbitrary code can change the formals of an active
function, but not the problem where arbitrary can could inspect those
formals.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  It's daring of us to standardize restrictions on the behavior
of a feature that's not itself specified by the Standard.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> One suggestion that was made that I have not adopted in this draft
is that if a reference to <code>arguments</code> is visible in the code of a
strict function then the formals should be made read-only so that the
captured arguments array would always hold the same values as the
formals.  The problem with this, of course, is that <code>eval</code> can
reference <code>arguments</code> without that reference being visible when the
function is entered.  So what should happen if <code>arguments</code> is
referenced by <code>eval</code> code after one of the formals has been changed?
Is the <code>arguments</code> object captured at that point (not on function
entry), and are the formals made read-only at that point?  It doesn't
seem to be worth the bother to do this.
