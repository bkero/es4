OPEN ISSUES

  (Note, in the absense of debate on the following issues the
  resolution will invariably be to make no changes to the draft.)

  * There is no way to control enumerability of a property without
    giving it a non-public namespace or making it a fixture.  One
    possibility without adding yet another keyword is to signal
    non-enumerability by the explicit use of the 'public' namespace:

       { public::x: 10 }  /* not enumerable */

    It's unambiguous but feels a little hackish, since the rule
    for enumerability is that public properties are enumerable.

  * There is no way to seal the object created by an object
    initializer, as a prefix 'const' annotation only distributes
    across the fields of the object and does not imply anything about
    the object as a whole.

  * The meta::prototype facility does not allow 'null' as a value.
    Brendan thinks it's important that it should allow that in order
    to allow objects to work as primitive (but reliable) maps; I'm not
    sure what the impact will be.  In particular, objects thus created
    cease to behave like other objects in the system, as they will
    have no (prototype) method suite.  Of course, the intrinsic
    methods will still be there.  Discuss.

  * It would be possible to replace 'meta::get()', 'meta::set()',
    'meta::has()', 'meta::delete()', 'meta::invoke()', and
    'meta::prototype()' with 'get*()', 'set*()', 'has*()',
    'delete*()', 'invoke*()', and '__proto__', respectively.  The
    purpose would be to avoid having to worry about whether the
    identifier 'meta' can be used as a syntax marker in the way it
    currently is.


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 2 (2008-04-07)

  * Removed the copying of type information from initializing
    expressions to fixtures in the case of 'const' and 'var' annotated
    properties

  * Made it possible to make a getter/setter pair into a fixture
    by annotating the getter and setter with 'var'.

  * Many(!) small wording changes and bug fixes (thanks to Brendan)


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 1 (2008-03-20)

  * Added optional 'const' and 'var' prefixes to the initializer to
    imply 'const' or 'var' for all fields.

  * Specified that a 'const' or 'var' prefix on a field records the
    type of the value being stored in the type of the object, absent
    any other annotation; the previous draft used '*' for the types.

  * Specified that repeated field names are allowed only if the
    initializer as a whole does not use any new ES4 features

  * Introduced catch-all methods 'meta::get' and so on

  * Introduced 'meta::prototype'

  * Added the facility described in [6] for annotating the initializer
    with a nominal class type.

  * Added "Open issues" section; one more reference; wording changes.

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This draft spec tries to pin down everything that has been
proposed and tentatively agreed about object initializer syntax and
semantics.  A brief rationale is attached at the end.


<h2>Primary syntax</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In its general form an object initializer is comprised of an
optional keyword (<code>const</code> or <code>var</code>), followed by a brace-delimited
comma-separated list of fields with the last field optionally followed
by a comma, followed by an optional type annotation.

<PRE>
    ObjInit ::= ["const" | "var"] "{" ( ( Field "," )* Field ","? )? "}" [ ":" Type ]
    Field   ::= FieldName ":" AssignmentExpression
              | "var" FieldName ":" AssignmentExpression
              | "const" FieldName ":" AssignmentExpression
              | ["var"] "get" FieldName "(" ")" [":" Type] FunctionBody
              | ["var"] "set" FieldName "(" Param ")" [ ":" "void" ] FunctionBody
              | "meta" "::" "prototype" ":" AssignmentExpression
              | "meta" "::" "get" "(" Param ")" [":" Type] FunctionBody
              | "meta" "::" "set" "(" Param "," Param ")" [ ":" "void" ] FunctionBody
              | "meta" "::" "has" "(" Param ")" [":" "boolean"] FunctionBody
              | "meta" "::" "delete" "(" Param ")" [ ":" "void" ] FunctionBody
              | "meta" "::" "invoke" "(" ( Param ( "," Param )* )? ")" [ ":" Type ] FunctionBody
    FieldName ::= AnyIdentifier | AnyIdentifier "::" AnyIdentifier | LiteralString | LiteralNumber
    AnyIdentifier ::= Identifier | ReservedWord
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a FieldName has a qualifier then the qualifier must name a
binding created by a <code>namespace</code> directive and the qualifier cannot
be the name of a reserved namespace (<code>meta</code>, <code>intrinsic</code>,
<code>reflect</code>, and so on).

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The "Type" that annotates the initializer must be a record type or
a class type whose constructor accepts zero arguments.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>FunctionBody</code> of a getter, <code>meta::get</code>, <code>meta::has</code>,
and <code>meta::invoke</code> may be a block or an expression.  The
<code>FunctionBody</code> of a setter, <code>meta::set</code>, and <code>meta::delete</code> must
be a block.  (See also [10].)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> It is possible to have a getter without a setter and a setter
without a getter.  A compatible getter or setter will be generated for
the missing method.  The generated setter method receives a value and
discards it silently (this corresponds with the view that writing to
ReadOnly properties fails silently).  The generated getter method
throws a <b>ReferenceError</b>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the initializer is prefixed by <code>const</code> then <code>const</code> is
implied for each of the fields in the structure.  Every field must be
a <code>fieldname:value</code> field, and none of the fields may have
<code>const</code> or <code>var</code> annotations.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the initializer is prefixed by <code>var</code> then <code>var</code> is implied
for each of the fields in the structure.  A field must be either
<code>fieldname:value</code>, a getter, or a setters, and none of the fields
may have <code>const</code> or <code>var</code> annotations.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Field names may be repeated only if the initializer as a whole
looks like an object initializer as defined in E262-3 (1999), ie, all
fields are of the <code>FieldName&nbsp;:&nbsp;AssignmentExpression</code> form,
there is no <code>const</code> or <code>var</code> qualifier on the initializer as a
whole, and there is no type annotation on the initializer.


<h3>Construction</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Unlike the case in ES3, the program can't shadow the binding for
<code>Object</code> in order to invoke an alternative object constructor for
object initializers.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Though ES4 is incompatible with ES3 here, most real-world
implementations of ES3 do not respect shadowing binding for <code>Object</code>
when evaluating object initializers, and the incompatibility is of no
consequence.  See [8].

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a type annotates the initializer and that type is a class type
then the object initializer syntax is shorthand for the creation of an
instance of that type with assignments to properties of the fields of
that instance.  In other words, given

<PRE>
   class Point { var x, y }
</PRE>

then

<PRE>
   { x: 10, y: 20 } : Point
</PRE>

is shorthand for

<PRE>
   (let (TMP = new Point)
     (TMP.x = 10,
      TMP.y = 20,
      TMP))
</PRE>

for some fresh variable TMP.  In this case, all fields of the object
literal must be of the <code>FieldName&nbsp;:&nbsp;AssignmentExpression</code>
form.  (See the Rationale section for a discussion of why this is
desirable.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> In all other cases, the initializer evaluates to an instance of
<code>Object</code> or an anonymous subtype of <code>Object</code>, as described in the
rest of this document.


<h2>Secondary syntax</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Suppose T is a structural record type:

<PRE>
    type T = { x: int, y: double }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Then the <code>new</code> operator can be used as follows:

<PRE>
    new T(10, 2.5)
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The meaning of this is precisely:

<PRE>
    { x: 10, y: 2.5 } : T
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> There must be as many arguments to <code>new</code> as there are fields in
<code>T</code>.  The initializers are matched with fields by the order in which
they appear.


<h2>Semantics of subphrases</h2>

<h3>Types and fixtures</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a property name in the record type that annotates the literal
matches a field name in the literal then the field is a fixture (as
opposed to a dynamic property) and the type of the fixture is the type
of the property given in the record type.  The following makes <code>x</code> a
fixture and gives it the type <code>int</code>:

<PRE>
    { x: 10 } : { x: int }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The type of the value must be of the type of the field, or must be
convertible to the type of the field.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a literal field is annotated by <code>const</code> or <code>var</code> and the
field is also named in the record type that annotates the literal then
the type of the property is the type given in the record type, not the
type implied by the initial value of the property (see below).

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a property name in the record type matches a field name that is
a getter and/or a setter then:

<UL>

<LI> either the getter has no return type annotation (in which case
the type from the record type will be applied to the getter) or the
return type must be equal to the type present for the property in the
record type;

<LI> either the setter has no parameter type annotation (in which case
the type from the record type will be applied to the parameter) or the
parameter type must be equal to the type present for the property in
the record type; and

<LI> following resolution of the previous two points, the return type of the 
(generated) getter, the parameter type of the (generated) setter, and the
type in the record type must all be equal.

</UL>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Fields may be present in the field list that are not present in
the type, but not vice versa.  I.e., the following is legal:

<PRE>
    x = { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 } : { x: int, y: int }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A field that does not have a matching explicit type annotation in
the record type is dynamic, which is to say it is deletable.  Note in
particular that this applies to getters and setters.  A getter/setter
pair can be deleted only as a unit.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a field name that has a getter/setter pair is not mentioned in
the record type for the object initializer then the getter's return
type must be equal to the setter's parameter type.


<h3>Namespaces</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Fields are in the public namespace if they don't have an explicit
qualifier.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The <code>use default namespace</code> pragma does not apply to object
initializers.


<h3>Enumerability</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> As outlined elsewhere [9], fixture properties are never
enumerable.  Dynamic fields are enumerable if they are in the public
namespace and their <code>enumerable</code> attribute is set.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> All dynamic fields created by an object initializer have their
<code>enumerable</code> attribute set (though the attribute setting is only
relevant if the fields are public).


<h3>const</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>const</code> attribute introduces a fixture.  The meaning of

<PRE>
    { const x: E }
</PRE>

is the same as the meaning of

<PRE>
    { x: E } : { x: * }
</PRE>

with the additional constraint that the <code>writable</code> attribute on
<code>x</code> is disabled (<code>x</code> is ReadOnly in ES3 terms).


<h3>var</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>var</code> attribute introduces a fixture.  The meaning of

<PRE>
    { var x: E }
</PRE>

is the same as the meaning of

<PRE>
    { x: E } : { x: * }
</PRE>

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Object initializers using the <code>var</code> attribute can always
be rewritten as type-annotated initializers.


<h3>Getters and setters</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A getter (<code>get Name() &#x0085;</code>) must not take any arguments.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A getter must not be declared to return <code>void</code>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A setter (<code>set Name() &#x0085;</code>) may be declared as returning
<code>void</code> but must not be declared as returning any other type.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the program reads a property from an object and that property
was named by a getter, then the getter method is invoked and the 
value returned by the getter method is returned to the program.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the program writes a property to an object and that property
was named by a setter, then the setter method is invoked with the
value being written as its only argument.  The value returned by the
setter method, if any, is discarded.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Inside the getter and setter methods the value of <code>this</code> refers
to the object on which the property access was performed.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  That is the same rule as for normal method invocation.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a getter or setter is prefixed by <code>var</code> then the
getter/setter pair is a fixture.  If the initializer has both a getter
and a setter for the same field then both or neither must be annotated
<code>var</code>.


<h3>Catch-all methods</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Catch-all methods (<code>meta::get</code>, <code>meta::set</code>, <code>meta::has</code>,
<code>meta::delete</code>, and <code>meta::invoke</code>) are the values of read-only
fixture properties on the object that is created by the object
initializer expression.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The full catch-all protocol is described elsewhere.  Here is a
summary.

<P class="note"> Some catch-all methods are invoked when an object
property is accessed by a primitive protocol and the property is not a
fixture of the object.  In ES3 terms, <code>meta::get</code> is invoked by
<code>[[Get]]</code>; <code>meta::set</code> is invoked by <code>[[Put]]</code>; <code>meta::has</code> is invoked
by <code>[[HasProperty]]</code>; and <code>meta::delete</code> is invoked by <code>[[Delete]]</code>.
These four catch-all methods receive the name of the property being
accessed as the first argument (currently encoded as a Name, a string,
or a nonnegative integer value below 2<SUP>32</SUP>-1).

<P class="note"> The catch-all methods handling properties are always
invoked, even if a property being sought is defined as a dynamic
property on the object.

<P class="note"> The catch-all method <code>meta::invoke</code> is invoked when
the object is called as a function.

<P class="note"> A catch-all method operates on the own object (the
value of <code>this</code>) and can either terminate normally by returning or
else signal to its caller -- by throwing a distinguished exception --
that default behavior should be invoked on the object.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A catch-all field is syntactically distinguished by the use of the
identifier <code>meta</code> in a namespace position.  At the time the object
initializer is evaluated the name <code>meta</code> must reference a namespace
binding, that namespace binding must come from an scope object that is
not introduced by <code>with</code>, and the value of the namespace binding
must be the <code>meta</code> namespace defined in the global object.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The previous paragraph attempts to express the notion that the
binding for <code>meta</code> is invariant so that we can rely on its meaning
as syntax.  There is more to be said on that matter; the above
language will be adjusted as some of these details are worked out.
See also OPEN ISSUES.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Catch-all methods can have type annotations in their parameter and
return positions.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Catch-all properties can appear in the record type that annotates
the initializer.  Any types for catch-all properties in the record
type must be equal to the declared types of the catch-all methods in
the initializer itself.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Even if not mentioned in the record type that annotates the
initializer, catch-all properties have field types derived from the
annotations on the catch-all methods.


<h3>meta::prototype</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The special field name <code>meta::prototype</code> allows a value to be
specified for the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> object of the newly
constructed object.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The value for <code>meta::prototype</code> must not be undefined or null.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> As for catch-all methods, this field is syntactically
distinguished by the use of the <code>meta</code> namespace.  At the time the
object initializer is evaluated the name <code>meta</code> must reference the
immutable binding for the <code>meta</code> namespace in the global object.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The syntax <code>meta::prototype</code> exists for initializing the
<code>[[Prototype]]</code> object only; it is not available for reading the
<code>[[Prototype]]</code> value from the object in any context.


<h2>Rationale</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> (Will not be part of the final spec.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The provision for an optional trailing comma comes from an early
bug fix proposal.  It benefits machine-generated code and maintenance
of lengthy initializers; ES3 array initializers permit a trailing
comma; and the same convention is available in C.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Getters and setters have found a lot of use on the web and are a
much-desired feature, even the ES3.1 group has been debating it.  They
are implemented in the form presented here in Firefox, Opera, and
Safari, at least.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> <code>const</code> fields are motivated by the practical need to protect
some object fields from being deleted or changed while staying within
the easy to manage world of object initializers (ES4 classes would do
the job but are more heavyweight by far).  Structural type annotations
cannot express what <code>const</code> can express, either.  Some examples of
the use of <code>const</code> are presented in the paper, "Evolutionary
programming and gradual typing in ECMAScript 4", available from
ecmascript.org.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> <code>var</code> fields are similar to <code>const</code> fields in that they
prevent fields from being deleted while staying within the easy to
manage world of unannotated object initializers.  (<code>var</code> fields can
be expressed by structural type annotations and are a syntactic
convenience.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Allowing a single <code>const</code> or <code>var</code> to cover all fields in the
initializer simplifies programs.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Syntax for catchalls is provided because it's sugar for
functionality that is almost available. However, restrictions on the
use of the <code>meta</code> namespace (which is reserved by the language
implementation) prevent the creation of fields like this:

<PRE>
    meta::get: function (name) ...
</PRE>

and it is clearer to provide the functionality directly.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Given that the full catch-all syntax, e.g.  <code>meta::get()</code>, has
parentheses as well as the quasi-keyword <code>meta</code>, there's no
ambiguity about what's going on (except for <code>meta::prototype</code>), and
programs aren't prevented from using <code>meta</code> as a variable or
property name in any context (only from evaluating object initializers
containing catch-alls in contexts where a binding of <code>meta</code> shadows
the original binding).

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Syntax for setting up the prototype chain is provided because it's
a common need and because it provides power that is not available
without the new syntax.  (ES3 style constructor functions can only
create objects of the empty object type; field types cannot be
introduced.  Yet ES3 style constructor functions are the only other
means available to create a custom prototype chain.)  Also, the
initializer-based syntax prevents cycles in the prototype graph.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Structural type annotations on object initializers are a
convenient shorthand for creating typed fixtures on objects without
having to go the roundabout way through full classes.  "I want to
guarantee that these fields are here and that they have these types."
It's lightweight integrity.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>new</code> syntax is part of the evolutionary programming agenda
and is yet another point on the continuum between ES3 programs and
class-based ES4 programs (the syntax abstracts away from the type T
that is the subject of <code>new</code> -- whether it's a class or a structural
type).  For example

<PRE>
   type Point = { x:double, y:double }
   new Point(10, 20)
</PRE>

can change into

<PRE>
   class Point { var x: double, y: double }
   new Point(10, 20)
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Nominal type annotations on object initializers further the
evolutionary programming agenda in that objects described by
structural types can be migrated to classes with only surface changes;
existing object initializer expressions that use the structural type
will continue to work when the type becomes a class.  For example,

<PRE>
   type Point = { x:double, y:double }
   { x:10, y:20 } : Point
</PRE>

can change into

<PRE>
   class Point { var x: double, y: double }
   { x:10, y:20 } : Point
</PRE>
