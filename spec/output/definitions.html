<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>Binding forms and scopes</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> (Some of this may belong elsewhere in the spec but I felt it was
necessary to gather it all here, for the moment.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> <i>Names</i> are <i>bound</i> in <i>scopes</i> by <i>defining forms</i> and
<i>binding forms</i>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The defining forms are <i>VariableDefinition</i>,
<i>FunctionDefinition</i>, <i>ClassDefinition</i>, <i>InterfaceDefinition</i>,
<i>TypeDefinition</i>, <i>NamespaceDefinition</i>.  Except in block scopes
(see below) a defining form permits the name to be qualified by a
namespace.  The current default namespace is used if no qualifier is
present.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> (The initial default namespace in any block scope is <code>public</code>, and it is
not legal to set a different default namespace in a block scope.
Therefore all names bound in block scopes are in the <code>public</code>
namespace.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The binding forms are <i>FunctionExpression</i>, <i>LetExpression</i>,
<i>CatchClause</i>, <i>TypeCaseElement</i>, <i>LetStatement</i>,
<i>LetBlockStatement</i>, <i>ForStatement</i>, and <i>ArrayComprehension</i>.
The binding forms do not permit names to be qualified by namespaces;
all names bound by these forms are in the <code>public</code> namespace.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Names can be <i>created</i> in the global scope at run-time by means
of assignment.  (Run-time creation of names is not possible in strict
code.)  These names can have non-<code>public</code> namespace qualifiers.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Names are also <i>introduced</i> in scopes by the <i>WithStatement</i>.
(The <i>WithStatement</i> is disallowed in strict code.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Bound, created, and introduced names are visible in the entire
scope of the binding.  However, scoping is static -- it is determined
by the source text -- and bindings in inner scopes can <i>shadow</i>
bindings in outer scopes.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Names that are introduced by defining forms and binding forms are
<i>fixtures</i>: they are guaranteed always to be present at run-time.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The following are the scopes and the forms that introduce names in
those scopes:

<UL>
  <LI> The global scope is shared between multiple <i>Programs</i>.  It
  contains pre-defined bindings (the language-defined libraries and
  any host-defined extensions) and is extended when definitions have
  an effect on it.  A possibly unbounded sequence of <i>Programs</i>
  operates upon the global scope in a linear order.  A definition
  introduced by a later <i>Program</i> is visible to every earlier
  <i>Program</i>.

  <P > The forms that introduce names into the global environment are
  <i>VariableDefinition</i>, <i>ClassDefinition</i>,
  <i>InterfaceDefinition</i>, <i>TypeDefinition</i>,
  <i>NamespaceDefinition</i>, <i>FunctionDefinition</i>, and
  <i>AssignmentStatement</i>.


  <LI> The class static scope extends from the left curly brace that
  starts the class body to the right curly brace that ends the class
  body.  The class static scope is nested within the global scope.

  <P > The forms that introduce names into the class static scope are
  the <code>static</code> annotated forms of <i>VariableDefinition</i>,
  <i>TypeDefinition</i>, <i>NamespaceDefinition</i>, and
  <i>FunctionDefinition</i>.  The class static scope cannot be extended
  at run-time or by definitions following the right brace of the class
  body.

  <P > The outer scope of a function defined in the class static scope
  is that class static scope.


  <LI> The class instance scope is defined by multiple disjoint pieces
  of text.  It extends from the left curly brace that starts the class
  body to the right curly brace that ends the class body.  It also
  incorporates the class instance scope of its direct superclass
  (which incorporates the class instance scope of <i>its</i> direct
  superclass, and so on).

  <P > The class instance scope for a class definition is nested within
  the class static scope for that definition.

  <P > The forms that introduce names into the class instance scope are
  <i>VariableDefinition</i> and <i>FunctionDefinition</i>.

  <P > The outer scope of a function defined in the class instance
  scope is that instance scope; however, a function inherited from a
  superclass is closed in the instance scope of the class from which
  it is inherited.


  <LI> The function scope extends from the left parenthesis of the
  function parameter list through the right curly brace that ends the
  function body (or the end of the expression, for an expression
  closure).

  <P > Since a static initializer block for a class is treated as an
  anonymous function, the function scope extends also from the left
  curly brace of the initializer block through the closing right curly
  brace.

  <P > (Constructor scope?)

  <P > The forms that introduce names into a function scope are
  <i>VariableDefinition</i> and <i>FunctionDefinition</i>.


  <LI> The block scope is introduced by the left curly brace of
  certain source phrases (<i>Block</i>, <i>SwitchStatement</i>,
  <i>CatchClause</i>, <i>TypeCaseElement</i>, and <i>LetBlockStatement</i>) and
  extends to the matching right curly brace. 

  <P > The forms that introduce names into a block scope are
  <i>VariableDefinition</i> and <i>FunctionDefinition</i>.
  <i>LetBlockStatement</i>, <i>CatchClause</i>, and <i>TypeCaseElement</i>.


  <LI> The statement scope is introduced by a binding statement form
  (a <i>WithStatement</i> or a binding <i>ForStatement</i>) and extends
  through the end of the statement's substatement.

  <P > There are no forms to introduce new names into statement scopes
  apart from the binding statement forms themselves.


  <LI> The expression scope is introduced by the left parenthesis of a
  <i>LetExpression</i>, the name of a named <i>FunctionExpression</i>, or
  the left square bracket of an <i>ArrayComprehension</i>.  The scope
  extends to the end of the <i>LetExpression</i>, the end of the
  <i>FunctionExpression</i>, or to the matching right square bracket of
  the array comprehension.

  <P > There are no forms to introduce new names into expression scopes
  except the names introduced by those expression forms themselves:
  the names introduced in the <i>LetExpression</i> head, the name of the
  <i>FunctionExpression</i>, and the names introduced by <code>for</code> and
  <code>let</code> clauses in the <i>ArrayComprehension</i>.
  
</UL>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> As a rule it is not legal to introduce the same name in the same
scope more than once.  (Note in particular that top-level bindings in
a function are bound in the same scope as the function's parameters
and its <code>arguments</code> object.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> However, in "strict" code more than one <code>var</code> (or <code>let</code>)
binding can introduce the same name in the same global, function, or
block scope, provided the two bindings have the same type annotation
(or no annotation at all).  The binding keyword used to bind the name
must be the same in all the binding forms that introduce the name.
(Parameters and the <code>arguments</code> object are assumed to be bound by
some system-internal binding form, not <code>var</code>, and duplicate
parameter names are not allowed.)

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Additionally, in "standard" mode the following are also allowed
(in order to be compatible with ES3):

<UL>

  <LI> Parameter bindings and the <code>arguments</code> binding are assumed to
  be bound as if by <code>var</code>, so duplicate parameter names are allowed,
  as are <code>var</code> bindings in a function body that bind names that are
  also bound as parameters.

  <LI> Multiple <code>var</code> and <code>function</code> forms may bind the same name,
  provided the bindings are all unannotated.
  
</UL>

<h3>Note on shadowing</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> "use namespace" controls the shadowing, to an extent.  A shadowed
identifier in a base class may sometimes be made visible in a subclass
by means of a <i>SuperExpression</i>.

<h3>Source-to-source transformations</h3>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> It's probably useful to note the following rewrites:

<PRE>
    let (a=b, c=d) {
        ...
    }
</PRE>

becomes

<PRE>
    {
        let T1 = b, T2 = d
        {
            let a = T1, b = T2
            {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> While this:

<PRE>
    for ( let i=j ; i &#60; n ; i++ )
        ...
</PRE>

becomes this:

<PRE>
    let (T=j) {
        let i;
        for ( i=T ; i &#60; n ; i++ )
            ...
    }
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> And this:

<PRE>
    var x = function f() { ... }
</PRE>

becomes this:

<PRE>
    var x = let (f = function() { ...}) f
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Finally, an array comprehension that binds names:

<PRE>
    [i*j+k for (i in ...) for (j in ...) let (k = ...)]
</PRE>

becomes:

<PRE>
    (function () {
        let i, j, k;
        let T = []
        for (i in ...) {
            for (j in ...) {
                k = ...;
                T[T.length] = i*j+k
            }
        }
        return T;
    })()
</PRE>

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Note that the names are not bound by the <code>for</code> and <code>let</code>
clauses, this makes a difference if the array initializer expression
captures them.  I suspect that's probably a bug, but it's how Brendan
explained it.


<h2>Forward definitions</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The following kinds of forward definition are available and are
legal on the top level only.  (It would make syntactic sense to allow
forward static <code>type</code> definitions in classes but since the type
would have to be introduced in the class body anyway it has no(?)
utility.)

<PRE>
    ns [dynamic] [final] class Cls.&lt;T,...&gt;
    ns interface Iface.&lt;T,...&gt;
    ns type T.&lt;T,...&gt;
</PRE>


<h2>Initialization</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> There is an order here.  Following is a sketch of how I think it
needs to work.  I haven't yet looked at the reference implementation.

<UL>
  <LI> All names introduced in the scope are defined in the scope.
  Names that would replace existing forward-declared bindings are
  ignored (provided that ...).  Names that would replace existing reserved
  names cause errors to be signalled (obviously only the first such
  name can be detected).

  <LI> Namespace definitions are evaluated in an order such that there
  are no forward references during evaluation.  Circularities cause
  syntax errors.

  <LI> Type definitions are evaluated in an order such that there are
  no forward references during type expression evaluation.
  Forward-declared types are initialized with placeholder type objects
  at the outset.  If a type definition names a forward-declared type
  name then the definition must match the particulars of the forward
  declaration (type parameters).  If a forward declaration names an
  existing forward declaration or an actual definition then the
  forward declaration must match the particulars of the existing name.

  <LI> Interface definitions are evaluated in an order such that there
  are no forward references during interface definition.
  Forward-declared interfaces are initialized with placeholder
  interface objects.  If an interface definition names a forward
  declared binding then there must be a match.  etc.

  <LI> Class definitions are evaluated in an order that etc.  Note
  that this does not require the base classes to be available, nor
  does it require types referenced from the class body to be
  available, but everything that's not available must be present as a
  forward definition.

  <LI> Functions are installed in function bindings, in file
  definition order.

  <LI> Variables not also named by functions are given undefined
  values (per ES3)

  <LI> The code in the scope, if any, is run in file definition order.
  This includes running static class initializers are run in file
  definition order.  When the class initializers are run, all the
  types referenced by static parts of the class must be fully
  available: all forward references must be resolved.

  <LI> When the (dynamically) first instance of a class is created
  sometime later the instance template is initialized.  At that point,
  all base classes and all types used by instance methods and instance
  variables must be fully resolved.

</UL>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The static initializer for a parameterized class may be run
multiple times, once for each first instantiation of the class.
Instantiations must be hash-consed; <code>Cls.&lt;double&gt;</code> denotes the
same class everywhere and the static initializer is only run once.


<h2>NamespaceDefinition</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A <i>NamespaceDefinition</i> introduces an immutable, initialized
binding for a (possibly qualified) name into the appropriate scope.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> (To be replaced by the ASTs eventually.)

<pre>
    ns namespace N1
    ns namespace N2 = N1
    ns namespace N3 = "org.ecmascript.es4"
</pre>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The value of the new binding is a <code>Namespace</code> object.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the <i>NamespaceDefinition</i> has an initialization clause whose
value is a <i>PrimaryName</i> then that name must resolve to a namespace
value at compile time, and the value of the new binding is the same
(in terms of <code>===</code>) as the value of the initialization clause.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  For compile-time resolution of namespaces and types, see
chapter 666.


<h2>TypeDefinition</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A <i>TypeDefinition</i> introduces an immutable, initialized binding
for a (possibly qualified) name into the appropriate scope.

<pre>
    ns type T = TypeExpression
    ns type T.&lt;T1,...&gt; = TypeExpression
</pre>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <i>TypeExpression</i> is evaluated in the scope of the type
definition.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <i>TypeExpression</i> must be a compile-time resolvable type
expression, possibly after substituting (?) the type parameters <i>T1</i>
in <i>TypeExpression</i>.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Substitution almost certainly not what we're looking for here.
Presumably the chapter on types will have the right notions here.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The value of the new binding is an object implementing the
<code>reflect::Type</code> interface and one of its subinterfaces.  For
example, a type object representing a uniont type implements the
<code>reflect::UnionType</code> interface.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If the <i>TypeExpression</i> is a <i>PrimaryName</i> then the value of
the new binding is the same (in terms of <code>===</code>) as the value of the
<i>TypeExpression</i>.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  In fact, all types are normalized in some sense, so more types
than that are equal and that fact needs to be reflected here.
Presumably that also goes for resolved parameterzed types, but what
about unresolved parameterized types?


<h2>VariableDefinition</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> We have <code>var</code>, <code>const</code>, and <code>let</code> forms.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> <code>var</code> forms are hoisted out of block scopes to the enclosing
global or function scope, so the scope of a <code>var</code> binding is not the
block but the enclosing global or function scope.  But the initializer
clause, if any, stays put.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> forms are not hoisted.  Their scope is the
entire block, function, class, or global scope.  But the intializer
clause, if any, stays put.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> bound variable is read before it has
been initialized then a <b>ReferenceError</b> is thrown.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A <code>const</code> bound variable can be written at most once.  A
subsequent write causes a <b>ReferenceError</b> to be thrown.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is probably a language bug -- resulting from the old
thinking about <code>let</code> scope as different from <code>var</code> scope -- that
<code>let</code> can't be used to introduce names in class static and class
instance scopes, since the read barrier check might be valuable there.


<h2>FunctionDefinition</h2>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> We have the <code>function</code> and <code>const function</code> forms.


<h2>ClassDefinition</h2>


<h2>InterfaceDefinition</h2>
