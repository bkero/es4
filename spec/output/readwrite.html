<h1>Reading and writing properties</h1>

<pre>
Draft 0.5, 2008-05-12 / lth
</pre>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This chapter describes the algorithms for <i>property access</i>:
testing objects for the presence of a property, reading from and
writing to a property, and removing a property.  Property access is
always by the name of the property.  A property name is represented
either as an instance of the pre-defined class <code>Name</code>, or as a plain
string (which represents a name in the <code>public</code> namespace).

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This chapter complements the chapter on names, scopes, and name
resolution.  At this time, there is probaly some overlap between the
two chapters.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Property accesses are subject to run-time checks, and property
access fails with an exception being thrown if a check does not pass.
The exact exception depends on the particular check.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  For example, a property created by <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> or a
property whose type is a non-nullable type without a default value
must be written (initialized) before it is read; properties created by
<code>const</code> cannot be written more than once; and properties that have
type annotations can be updated with a new value only if the allocated
type of the value is a compatible subtype of the annotation type.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A property may be virtual, that is to say, the reading and writing
of the property may be implemented by <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i>
methods on the object, and an expression that is syntactically a
reference to the property is in fact an invocation of these methods.
Virtual dynamic (non-fixed) properties may be implemented by
<i>catch-all</i> methods, described in the next section.


<h1>Catch-all methods</h1>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This section contains is a normative overview of the catch-all
behavior in the language.  A more precise, also normative, description
is given in later sections of this chapter, as part of the general
description of property access.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Any conflicts between the two descriptions are obviously bugs.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Objects may contain fixture properties in the <code>meta</code> namespace:
<code>meta::get</code>, <code>meta::set</code>, <code>meta::has</code>, and <code>meta::delete</code>.
These properties always name methods (the syntactic constructs that
introduce them only allow them to carry method values).  Jointly they
are known as <i>catch-all methods</i>.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  There is also a <code>meta::invoke</code> catch-all which does not
participate in property access protocols and which is described
elsewhere.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a catch-all method is defined on the object then it is invoked
when a dynamic (non-fixture) is accessed: <code>meta::has</code> is invoked to
determine if the object has the property; <code>meta::get</code> is invoked to
read a property's value; <code>meta::set</code> is invoked to update a
property; and <code>meta::delete</code> is invoked to delete a property.  A
catch-all method is invoked even if the dynamic property that is being
accessed already exists on the object.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A catch-all method operates on the object that contains the
method, not on that object's prototype objects.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a catch-all method returns normally then the value it returns
(if any) is the result of the operation, possibly converted to a
canonical type.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a catch-all method throws an exception, and the exception
thrown is an instance of the pre-defined class
<code>DefaultBehaviorClass</code>, then a default behavior is triggered.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> <code>DefaultBehaviorClass</code> is a singleton class; its only instance
is is stored in the global constant <code>DefaultBehavior</code>.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The mechanism is analogous to the one defined for iterators,
where an instance of the singleton <code>StopIterationClass</code> is stored in
the global property <code>StopIteration</code>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>meta::get</code> method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  The value returned is the property value.  The default behavior
for <code>meta::get</code> is to retrieve the value from a dynamic property in
the object's property map.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>meta::set</code> method is invoked on two arguments, a property
name and a value.  Any value returned is ignored.  The default
behavior for <code>meta::set</code> is to update or attempt to create a dynamic
property on the object.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>meta::has</code> method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  Any value returned by the method is converted to <code>boolean</code>.
The default behavior for <code>meta::has</code> is to search for a dynamic
property in the object's property map.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>meta::delete</code> method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  Any value returned by the method is converted to <code>boolean</code>.
The default behavior for <code>meta::delete</code> is to attempt to delete a
dynamic property in the object's property map.


<h1>Checking for the presence of a property</h1>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>hasProperty</code> protocol is invoked to check whether an object
<i>obj</i> contains a property <i>name</i>.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  In terms of the 3rd Edition Specification, the <code>hasProperty</code>
protocol implements the test for whether an object "has a property",
as used in the implementations of <code>[[Get]]</code>, <code>[[Put]]</code>, <code>[[HasProperty]]</code>,
and other internal subroutines.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> An object is said to contain a property if the property is in the
object's prototype map or if the <code>meta::has</code> catchall claims the
object to be present.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This protocol must be specified as SML code.

<PRE>
fun hasProperty(obj, name)
  if (name is a property in the property map of obj, denote it obj.name &&
      the isFixed attribute of obj.name is true)
    return true
  end

  if (meta::has is a property in the property map of obj, denote it obj.meta::has && 
      the isFixed attribute of obj.meta::has is true)
    try 
      return the result of the call obj.meta::has(name)
    catch DefaultBehaviorClass
      ; fall through to the next case
    end
  end
  
  if (name is a property in the property map of obj)
    return true
  end

  return false
end
</PRE>


<h1>Reading a property value</h1>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>getProperty</code> protocol is invoked to read the value of a
property <i>name</i> from an object <i>obj</i>.  The flag <i>isStrict</i> is
true if the ES4 code that caused <code>getProperty</code> to be invoked was
compiled in strict mode.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The notion of "ES4 code that caused <code>getProperty</code> to be
invoked" is a little soft and must be tighter.  The gist of it is that
there will be an AST node for property reference whose <code>strict</code> flag
is set because it originated in a region of code that was compiled in
strict mode.  There might even be several types of node, depending on
how the AST is structured.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>getProperty</code> protocol queries the object for the presence
of the property using the <code>hasProperty</code> protocol, moving up the
object's prototype chain if the object does not contain the property.
Once an object on the prototype chain is found that contains the
object, the <code>getPropertyHelper</code> protocol is invoked to extract the
property value.  If no property is found, then a default value may be
returned, or, in strict mode, and exception may be thrown.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The <code>getProperty</code> protocol here overlaps with the one
described in the chapter on names; the two must be reconciled that
will happen when the protocol here is described in terms of SML
(because then they will use the same code).

<PRE>
fun getProperty(obj, name, isStrict)
  for every object in obj, obj.[[Prototype]], obj.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]], ...)
    if hasProperty(obj, name)
      return getPropertyHelper(obj, name, isStrict)
    end
  end

  if obj allows dynamic property creation
    if obj has a type constraint on dynamic properties, denote it obj.[[DynamicType]]
      if obj.[[DynamicType]] has a default value
        return that default value
      else
        throw an error, "Cannot read uninitialized property with non-nullable type"
      end
    end
    return undefined
  end

  if isStrict
    throw an error, "Trying to read undefined property from non-dynamic object"
  end

  return undefined
end
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>getPropertyHelper</code> function reads the property from an
object.

<PRE>
fun getPropertyHelper(obj, name, isStrict)
  if (name is a property in the property map of obj, denote it obj.name && 
      the isFixed attribute of obj.name is true)
    if obj.name is a method
      return a closure where obj is bound as this to the method extracted from obj.name
    end
    if obj.name is a getter/setter pair, denote the getter obj.name.[[Getter]]
      return the result of invoking obj.name.[[Getter]](name)
    end
    return the value of obj.name
  end

  if (meta::get is a property in the property map of obj, denote it obj.meta::get && 
      the isFixed attribute of obj.meta::get is true)
    try 
      return the result of invoking obj.meta::get(name)
    catch DefaultBehavior
      ; fall through to the next case
    end
  end

  if name is a property in the property map of obj
    if obj.name is a getter/setter pair, denote the getter obj.name.[[Getter]]
      return the result of invoking obj.name.[[Getter]](name)
    end
    return obj.name
  end

  if isStrict
    throw a ReferenceError, "hasProperty lied about the existence of " + name
  else
    return undefined
  end
end
</PRE>


<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wrinkles not incorporated in the preceding algorithm yet are
"Upgrading" from type or namespace value (and maybe others?) to full
objects, and handling native properties.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  We need to specify whether the bound method is cached or not,
ie, if, given that o.m is a method, (o.m === o.m).


<h1>Writing a property value</h1>


<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>setProperty</code> protocol is invoked to write <i>value</i> to a
property <i>name</i> on an object <i>obj</i>.  The object may or may not
have a property of that name when <code>setProperty</code> is invoked.  The
flag <i>isStrict</i> is true if the ES4 code that caused <code>setProperty</code>
to be invoked was compiled in strict mode.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Se notes for <code>getProperty</code> above on strict mode.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This protocol must be specified as SML code.

  if the dynamic attribute on obj is true
    if isStrict && obj is a global object
      throw an error, "illegal to create props on global obj in strict mode"
    end

    if the type of value is not a compatible subtype of the dynamic property constraint of obj
      throw error "incompatible type"

}
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>setPropertyHelper</code> protocol is invoked when <i>name</i> is
known to name a property in <i>obj</i>.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Here I simply assume that methods are not writeable, but this
may or may not be the right abstraction we want to use; the RI has two
cases here anyway, and that's the code that will eventually be here.
