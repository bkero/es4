<h1>Reading and writing properties</h1>

<pre>
Draft 0.75, 2008-05-13 / lth
</pre>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This chapter describes the algorithms for <i>property access</i>:
testing objects for the presence of a property, reading from and
writing to a property, and removing a property.  Property access is
always by the name of the property.  A property name is represented
either as an instance of the pre-defined class <code>Name</code>, or as a plain
string (which represents a name in the <code>public</code> namespace).

<p class="note"><b>SPEC NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This chapter complements the chapter on names, scopes, and name
resolution.  At this time, there is probably some overlap between the
two chapters.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Property accesses are subject to run-time checks, and property
access fails (an exception is thrown) if a check does not pass.  The
exact exception depends on the particular check.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  For example, a property created by <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> or a
property whose type is a non-nullable type without a default value
must be written (initialized) before it is read; properties created by
<code>const</code> cannot be written more than once; and properties that have
type annotations can be updated with a new value only if the allocated
type of the new value is a compatible subtype of the storage type of
the property.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A property may be virtual, that is to say, the reading and writing
of the property may be implemented by <i>getter</i> and <i>setter</i>
methods on the object, and an expression that is syntactically a
reference to the property is in fact an invocation of these methods.
Virtual dynamic properties may be implemented by <i>catch-all</i>
methods, described in the next section.


<h1>Catch-all methods</h1>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> This section contains a normative overview of the catch-all
facility.  A more precise, also normative, description is given in
later sections of this chapter, as part of the general description of
property access.

<p class="note"><b>SPEC NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Any conflicts between the two descriptions are obviously bugs.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> Objects may contain fixture properties in the <code>meta</code> namespace:
<code>meta::get</code>, <code>meta::set</code>, <code>meta::has</code>, and <code>meta::delete</code>.
These properties always name methods (the syntactic constructs that
introduce them only allow them to carry method values).  Jointly they
are known as <i>catch-all methods</i>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a catch-all method is defined on the object then it is invoked
when a dynamic property is accessed: <code>meta::has</code> is invoked to
determine if the object has the property; <code>meta::get</code> is invoked to
read a property's value; <code>meta::set</code> is invoked to update or create
a property; and <code>meta::delete</code> is invoked to delete a property.  A
catch-all method is invoked even if the dynamic property that is being
accessed already exists on the object.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> A catch-all method operates on the object that contains the
method, not on that object's prototype objects.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a catch-all method returns normally then the value it returns
(if any) becomes the result of the operation, possibly after being
converted to a canonical type.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> If a catch-all method throws an exception, and the exception
thrown is an instance of the pre-defined class
<code>DefaultBehaviorClass</code>, then the default behavior for the catch-all
is triggered.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> <code>DefaultBehaviorClass</code> is a singleton class; its only instance
is is stored in the global constant <code>DefaultBehavior</code>.

<p class="note"><b>NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The mechanism is analogous to the one defined for iterators,
where an instance of the singleton <code>StopIterationClass</code> is stored in
the global property <code>StopIteration</code>.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>meta::get</code> method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  The value returned is the property value.  The default behavior
for <code>meta::get</code> is to retrieve the value from a dynamic property in
the object's property map.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>meta::set</code> method is invoked on two arguments, a property
name and a value.  Any value returned is ignored.  The default
behavior for <code>meta::set</code> is to update or attempt to create a dynamic
property in the object's property map.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>meta::has</code> method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  Any value returned by the method is converted to <code>boolean</code>.
The default behavior for <code>meta::has</code> is to search for a dynamic
property in the object's property map.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The <code>meta::delete</code> method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  Any value returned by the method is converted to <code>boolean</code>.
The default behavior for <code>meta::delete</code> is to attempt to delete a
dynamic property from the object's property map.


<h1>Checking for the presence of a property</h1>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The HasOwnProperty protocol is invoked to check whether an object
<i>obj</i> contains a property named by <i>name</i>.

<p class="note"><b>SPEC NOTE</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  In terms of the 3rd Edition Specification, the
HasOwnProperty protocol implements the test for whether an object "has
a property", as used in the implementations of <code>[[Get]]</code>, <code>[[Put]]</code>,
<code>[[HasProperty]]</code>, and other internal subroutines.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> An object is said to contain a property if the property is in the
object's prototype map or if the <code>meta::has</code> catchall claims the
object to be present.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This protocol must be specified as SML code.

<PRE>
fun HasOwnProperty(obj, name)
  if (name is a property in the property map of obj, denote it obj.name &&
      the isFixed attribute of obj.name is true)
    return true
  end

  if (meta::has is a property in the property map of obj, denote it obj.meta::has && 
      the isFixed attribute of obj.meta::has is true)
    try 
      return obj.meta::has(name)
    catch DefaultBehaviorClass
      ; fall through to the next case
    end
  end
  
  if (name is a property in the property map of obj)
    return true
  end

  return false
end
</PRE>


<h1>Reading a property value</h1>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The GetProperty protocol is invoked to read the value of a
property named by <i>name</i> from an object <i>obj</i>.  The flag
<i>isStrict</i> is true if the ES4 code that caused GetProperty to be
invoked was compiled in strict mode.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The notion of "ES4 code that caused GetProperty to be invoked"
is a little soft and must be tighter.  The gist of it is that there
will be an AST node for property reference whose <code>strict</code> flag is
set because it represents a source code phrase that was recognized in
a region of code that was covered by a strict mode pragma.  There
might even be several types of AST nodes carrying strict flags and
invoking GetProperty, depending on how the AST is structured.

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The GetProperty protocol queries the object for the presence of
the property using the HasOwnProperty protocol, moving up the object's
prototype chain if the object does not contain the property.  Once an
object on the prototype chain is found that contains the object, the
internal <code>getPropertyHelper</code> function is invoked to extract the
property value.  If no property is found, then a default value may be
returned, or, in strict mode, an exception may be thrown.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  The GetProperty protocol below overlaps with the one described
in the chapter on names; the two must be reconciled.  That will happen
when the protocol here is described in terms of SML (because then they
will use the same code).

<PRE>
fun GetProperty(obj, name, isStrict)
  for every object in obj, obj.[[Prototype]], obj.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]], ...
    if HasOwnProperty(obj, name)
      return getPropertyHelper(obj, name, isStrict)
    end
  end

  if obj allows dynamic property creation
    if obj has a type constraint on dynamic properties, denote it obj.[[DynamicType]]
      if obj.[[DynamicType]] has a default value
        return that default value
      else
        throw a ReferenceError, "Cannot read uninitialized property with non-nullable type"
      end
    end
    return undefined
  end

  if isStrict
    throw a ReferenceError, "Trying to read undefined property from non-dynamic object"
  end

  return undefined
end
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The internal <code>getPropertyHelper</code> function reads the property named by
<i>name</i> from an object <i>obj</i>, implementing strict mode checking if
<i>isStrict</i> is true.  An error is signalled in strict mode if the
object's <code>meta::has</code> catch-all returned true for <i>name</i> and the
property cannot be read.

<PRE>
fun getPropertyHelper(obj, name, isStrict)
  if (name is a property in the property map of obj, denote it obj.name && 
      the isFixed attribute of obj.name is true)
    if obj.name is a method
      return a closure where obj is bound as this to the method extracted from obj.name
    end
    if obj.name is a getter/setter pair, denote the getter obj.name.[[Getter]]
      return obj.name.[[Getter]](name)
    end
    return the value of obj.name
  end

  if (meta::get is a property in the property map of obj, denote it obj.meta::get && 
      the isFixed attribute of obj.meta::get is true)
    try 
      return obj.meta::get(name)
    catch DefaultBehavior
      ; fall through to the next case
    end
  end

  if name is a property in the property map of obj
    if obj.name is a getter/setter pair, denote the getter obj.name.[[Getter]]
      return obj.name.[[Getter]](name)
    end
    return obj.name
  end

  if isStrict
    throw a ReferenceError, "Property not found"
  else
    return undefined
  end
end
</PRE>


<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  We need to specify whether the bound method is cached or not,
ie, if, given that o.m is a method, (o.m === o.m).


<h1>Writing a property value</h1>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The SetProperty protocol is invoked to write a value <i>value</i> to
a property named by <i>name</i> on an object <i>obj</i>.  The object may or
may not have a property of that name when SetProperty is invoked, and
SetProperty may attempt to create the property.  The flag <i>isStrict</i>
is true if the ES4 code that caused SetProperty to be invoked was
compiled in strict mode.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Se notes for GetProperty above on strict mode.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This protocol must be specified as SML code.

fun SetProperty(obj, name, value, isStrict)

      the isFixed attribute of obj.name is true)

  end

  if the dynamic attribute on obj is true
    if isStrict && obj is a global object
      throw a ReferenceError, "illegal to create props on global obj in strict mode"
    end

    if the type of value is not a compatible subtype of the dynamic property constraint of obj

}
</PRE>

<P><span class="pcounter"></span> The internal <code>setPropertyHelper</code> function is invoked when
<i>name</i> is known to name a property in <i>obj</i>.

<p class="fixme"><b>FIXME</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Here I simply assume that methods are not writeable, but this
may or may not be the right abstraction we want to use; the RI has two
cases here anyway, and that's the code that will eventually be here.

<h1>Deleting a property</h1>
