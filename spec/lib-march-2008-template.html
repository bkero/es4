<center><b>Abstract</b></center>

<p> This document presents draft specifications for some of the
pre-defined types and objects in proposed ECMAScript 4.  Eventually
the document will incorporate approved specifications for all the
pre-defined types and objects, and it will itself be incorporated into
the final language standard.

<p> All the drafts that are presented in this document have been
subject to at least one round of discussion and refinement on the
''es4-discuss@mozilla.org'' mailing list; most drafts have been
through several rounds and are now considered more or less complete.

<p> All of the drafts included in this document will be subject to
(primarily minor) revisions as the language specification is developed
over the next half year.  In cases where the revisions are non-trivial
or non-obvious they will be discussed on the ''es4-discuss'' list.

<p> This document includes a short tutorial introduction to ES4 that
provides the reader with some of the necessary background for
understanding the draft specifications.  A high degree of familiarity
with ES3 is additionally required.  <hr>
