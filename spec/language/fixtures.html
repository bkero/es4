<p>ECMAScript provides for bindings that are either fixed and dynamic. 

<p>An expando (dynamic property) is introduced at runtime by an assignment to a non-existant 
property. Expandos are untyped and deleteable.

<p>A fixture (fixed property), on the other hand, is introduced by a static declaration and is
not deletable, has a storage type, and cannot be shadowed by dynamic bindings. Fixtures are
introduced by one of various forms including: //VariableDefinition//, //ClassDefinition//, 
//InterfaceDefinition//, and //TypeDefinition//.

<p>This section discusses the behaviors that are specific to fixtures. A more general discussion
of properties is provided in //section ..: ObjectType//

== Fixture Attributes ==

<p>Recall that object properties have four attributes: DD (don't delete), DE (don't enumerate),
RO (read only), and FX (fixed). Fixtures always have their DD and FX attributes set to **true**,
and always have their DE attribute initially set to **true**, and have their RO attribute set to 
**true** except when introduced by a non-const //VariableDefinition// or //FunctionDefinition//.

== Fixture Allocation ==

<p>Unlike expandos that are be allocated by an expression, fixtures are allocated upon entry to 
the lexical scope that they are defined in, and deallocated upon exit of that scope.

<p>Except for the timing of their creation, the allocation of fixtures is very much like the allocation
of expandos. Both fixtures and expandos have a binding that associates a name with a property value
that has four boolean attributes, a storage type (always ''*'' for expandos), and some property
state. (See //section ..: ObjectType// for details)

== Fixture Storage Type ==

<p>Each fixture has a storage type derived from its declaration. Value fixtures have a type that is 
explicitly declared with a type annotation. Other kinds of fixtures have a type that is implicitly
defined by its declaration. For example a function definition introduces a fixture that has
a function type with parameter types and result type as declared in the function definition. A
class definition introduces a fixture that has a anonymous structural (nominal?) type that describes 
the class object that is stored in that fixture.

== Fixture State ==

<p>Fixtures come in various forms but all express, explicitly or implicitly,
the initial state of the properties they represent. This state includes the four
attributes (DontEnum, DontDelete, ReadOnly, and Fixed), a type, and and an initial value.
The DontEnum, DontDelete and Fixed attributes are all set to true by default.

<p>The ReadOnly attribute is implicitly set to true for all but value fixtures.
The value of the RO attribute in this case is determined by the kind of definition
that the fixture represents. For example, a ''const'' definition results in
properties with their RO attribute set to true while a ''var'' definition results 
properties with their RO attribute set to false.

== Fixture Name Resolution ==

<p>Usability and soundness require that fixtures shadow expandos.
This is to say that the meaning of a name that can be resolved
ahead-of-time as per the static properties of programs must not be able to
change at runtime. Examples of such a forbidden changes are raising an 
ambiguous reference error or resolving a name to a different property.

<p>The //section ..: Names// describes the name lookup algorithm that operates on
a search chain of objects. To ensure that references don't change meaning
over time, this algorithm must be executed twice, the first time ignoring 
expandos. If this first phase completes
with a unique successful match or an error, the search is complete. If the
first phase complete without producing a unique successful match or an error,
the second phase begins.

<p>In the second phase, the multiname algorithm is run again with the same
starting conditions as the first phase. The difference with the second phase
is that every property is examined regardless of whether it is fixed or not.

=== Efficiency of two-phase lookup ===

<p>While this modified two-phase algorithm appears to double the amount
of work to do, in practical implementations it does the opposite,
greatly reducing the cost of multiname resolution. The reason is that
the set of fixtures visible in many contexts can be calculated
statically during parsing and compilation, and multiname references
can be resolved to names once during this stage, and never again at
runtime.

<p>Even if multiname resolution is delayed until runtime, a successful
multiname resolution to a fixture can frequently be cached -- for
example in cases of unqualified lexical references, or unqualified
object references on typed objects -- because no new fixtures may be
introduced at runtime that would make a successful fixture match
ambiguous.

=== Fixture often implies ReadOnly ===

<p>In addition to consts -- discussed elsewhere -- the fixtures
introduced by four significant families of ES4 declaration are
implicitly RO. These fixtures are:

<pre>
      type, class, interface, namespace
</pre>

<p>The fact that these fixtures are implicitly RO, combined with the fact
that multiname references to these fixtures can be resolved early or
cached (see section 4 above), means that many related runtime
calculations that depend on knowledge of these fixtures can also be
either performed early or cached.

<p>Crucially, the fact that namespace fixtures are constant permits
optimized resolution of namespace references and optimized execution
of the multiname algorithm in various contexts: those contexts
described in the namespace implementation note that require references
to namespace fixtures, rather than references to general namespace
values.

<p>None of these optimizations are mandatory, nor is any particular
balance or mixture of them implied by the model. The aim of the
fixture flag is to keep the door open for multiple efficient
implementation strategies.

== Fixture Hoisting ==

<p>Hoisting is a feature of ES by which a fixture might reside in a scope represented by a block outside of the block it is defined in. Except if defined by a &lsquo;let&rsquo; definition, a name is hoisted to the nearest enclosing global, class, or function (regional) scope. Inside of a class, static definitions are hoisted to the implicit class scope, and instance definitions are hoisted to the implicit instance scope.
</p>
<p>
The principle of domination is used to constrain the syntactic location of definitions. A name dominates a point in a program if, before hoisting, there is no path to that point in the program that does not pass through that definition.  
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> class and inteface fixtures shall dominate the end of the program</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> namespace and type fixtures shall dominate the end of the region</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> class static and instance fixtures shall dominate the end of the class</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> function fixtures shall dominate the end of the region</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no domination constraints on value (var and const) fixtures.
