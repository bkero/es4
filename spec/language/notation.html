== Grammar Notation ==

<p>The productions of the grammar are given in standard EBNF notation, as defined by ISO 14977, with
the following modifications to integrate ISO 10646 characters.

<p>When consisting only of typographically unambiguous characters within the initial 128 codes (in
the range 0 through 127 inclusive), the terminals of the grammar are written literally, following
the convention of ISO 14977.

<p>When containing characters 128 and above, or typographically ambiguous characters under 128, the
terminals of the grammar are written by denoting the numeric value of each character in the terminal
in sequence. This is done following the convention of writing "U+", followed by a hexadecimal number
indicating the character.

<p>The productions of the grammar are accompanied by abstract syntax trees (ASTs) defined as
datatypes in Standard ML, with nonterminal names in the grammar production repeated as
meta-variables in the AST to indicate the composition of ASTs from nonterminal sub-productions. No
parsing algorithm is specified.

== Core Semantics ==

<p>The formal semantics are specified using a definitional interpreter written in a small subset of
Standard ML (SML).

<p>Since this document uses SML as a specification mechanism, and since SML contains concepts such
as //type// and //value// that also occur as concepts of the specified language ECMAScript 4 (ES4),
some text may mix description of SML types and ES4 types, or SML values and ES4 values. Where such
mixtures occur in the text, the language in question is indicated. Where the context makes the
language clear, such qualification may be omitted.

<p>The subset of SML used is describe here.

=== Type constructors ===

{{{
type NAME = { id: IDENT, ns: NAMESPACE }
}}}

=== Value constructors ===

{{{
datatype NAMESPACE = Public of IDENT
}}}

=== Pattern Matching ===

{{{
case n of
    0 => "first"
  | _ => "second"
}}}

=== Bindings ===

{{{
val x = 10
}}}

=== Destructuring ===

{{{
val (x, y) = (10, 20)
val {a, b} = {a=10, b=20}
}}}

=== Functions and Recursion ===

{{{
fun recurse n = 
    case n of 
        0 => () 
      | _ => recurse n-1
}}}

=== Local Scope ===

{{{
let
    var x = 10
    fun recurse n = ...
in
    recurse x
end
}}}

== Built-in Semantics ==

<p>The built-in objects are defined using ECMAScript as defined in this specification. To aid the reader
the most important language features used to describe the builtins are summarized here.


== Code Style Guidelines ==

<p>In this section we define some common coding guidelines used in the formal
semantics. Some guidelines are common to both languages, others specific to one
or the other.

=== Common ===

<p>Don't rebind names

<p>Avoid generic names like "x" and "xs" when destructuring

<p>Use nested functions to factor out invariant arguments

<p>Use descriptive names, even if they are wordy

=== Standard ML ===

<p>Type names are all upper case

<p>Value constructors are leading upper case

<p>Function and variable  names are "camel" case

<p>Parenthesize the expression in the case head if it is anything
   but a variable

=== ECMAScript ===

== Source Text ==

ECMAScript source text is represented as a sequence of characters in the Unicode character encoding,
version 4.0 or later, using an unspecified encoding. The text is expected to have been normalised to
Unicode Normalized Form C (canonical composition), as described in Unicode Standard Annex
#15. Conforming ECMAScript implementations are not required to perform any normalisation of text, or
behave as though they were performing normalisation of text, themselves.

ECMAScript source text can contain any of the Unicode characters. All Unicode white space characters
are treated as white space, and all Unicode line/paragraph separators are treated as line
separators. Non-Latin Unicode characters are allowed in identifiers, string literals, regular
expression literals and comments.

Throughout the rest of this document, the phrase "code point" and the word "character" will be used
to refer to a 32-bit unsigned value used to represent a single 32-bit unit of UTF-32 text, as
defined by Unicode Standard Annex #19. Such a unit is sufficient to encode any character or code
point defined by the Unicode or ISO-10646 standards. These terms only refer to entities represented
by single Unicode code points: the components of a combining character sequence are still individual
characters, even though a user might think of the whole sequence as a single character.

In string literals, regular expression literals and identifiers, any character may also be expressed
as a Unicode escape sequence consisting of six characters, namely **\u** plus four hexadecimal
digits. Within a comment, such an escape sequence is effectively ignored as part of the
comment. Within a string literal or regular expression literal, the Unicode escape sequence
contributes one character to the value of the literal. Within an identifier, the escape sequence
contributes one character to the identifier.
