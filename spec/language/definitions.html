Definitions are introduced by 'var', 'function', 'let', 'const', 'class', 'interface', 'type', 'namespace'.

Definitions have a scope.

Scopes are:
  - global scope (for class, interface, type, namespace)
  - block scope (for let, function, const)
  - function scope (for hoisted vars only)
  - expression scope (for let-expressions)
  - class scope (static, instance?, interface?) (for var, function, const, type, namespace)

Definitions bind names that are visible in the entire scope.
