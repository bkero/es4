<!--
== Overview ==

=== Forms that introduce names ===

<P> (Some of this may belong elsewhere in the spec but I felt it was
necessary to gather it all here, for the moment.)

<P> //Names// are //bound// in //scopes// by //defining forms// and
//binding forms//.


==== Defined and bound names ====

<P> The defining forms are //VariableDefinition//,
//FunctionDefinition//, //ClassDefinition//, //InterfaceDefinition//,
//TypeDefinition//, and //NamespaceDefinition//.  Except in block
scopes (see below) a defining form permits the name to be qualified by
a namespace.  The current default namespace is used if no qualifier is
present.

<P> (The initial default namespace in any block scope is ''public'', and it is
not legal to set a different default namespace in a block scope.
Therefore all names bound in block scopes are in the ''public''
namespace.)

<P> The binding forms are //FunctionExpression//, //LetExpression//,
//CatchClause//, //TypeCaseElement//, //LetStatement//,
//LetBlockStatement//, //ForStatement//, and //ArrayComprehension//.
The binding forms do not permit names to be qualified by namespaces;
all names bound by these forms are in the ''public'' namespace.

<P> Names that are introduced by defining forms and binding forms are
//fixtures//: they are guaranteed always to be present at run-time.


==== Created and introduced names ====

<P> Names can be //created// dynamically (at run-time) in the global
scope by means of assignment and by the pre-defined global ''eval''
function.  Names can also be created dynamically in the global scope
and in any function scope by the ''eval'' operator evaluating a
program text that contains a top-level ''var'' or ''function''
definition,

<P> Names can be created dynamically in class static and class
instance scopes by creating a new property on the class object or the
instance object.  (Dynamic name creation is only possible on instances
of classes that are declared ''dynamic''.)

<P> Dynamic creation of names is not possible in strict code.
Top-level created names names can have non-''public'' namespace
qualifiers.

<P> Names that are created dynamically can be removed by means of the
''delete'' operator.

<P> Names are also //introduced// in scopes by the //WithStatement//.
(The //WithStatement// is disallowed in strict code.)

<P> Names that created dynamically are never fixtures.  Names that are
introduced by a //WithStatement// are as a rule not fixtures.  Created
and introduced names can as a rule appear and disappear at
unpredictable times during program evaluation.


==== Visibility ====

<FIXME> More here.

<P> Bound, created, and introduced names are visible in the entire
scope of the binding.  However, the scope of a binding is "static" (it
is determined by the source text) and bindings in inner scopes can
//shadow// bindings in outer scopes.

<P> "use namespace" controls the shadowing, to an extent.  

<P> A shadowed identifier in a base class may sometimes be made
visible in a subclass by means of a //SuperExpression//.


=== Scopes ===

<P> The following are the kinds of scopes and the forms that introduce
names in those scopes:

<UL>
  <LI> The //global scope// is shared between multiple //Programs//.
  It contains pre-defined bindings (the language-defined libraries and
  any host-defined extensions) and is extended when definitions have
  an effect on it.  A possibly unbounded sequence of //Programs// is
  evaluted in the global scope in a linear order.  A definition
  introduced by a later //Program// is visible to every earlier
  //Program//.

  <P > The forms that introduce names into the global environment are
  //VariableDefinition//, //ClassDefinition//,
  //InterfaceDefinition//, //TypeDefinition//,
  //NamespaceDefinition//, //FunctionDefinition//,
  //AssignmentStatement//, and //EvalExpression//.


  <LI> The //file scope// is specific to one "file", that is to say,
  one chunk of program text that matches the the //Program//
  nonterminal and which is processed independently from other files.

  <P > The only form that operates on the file scope is the //Pragma//.


  <LI> The //class static scope// extends from the left curly brace
  that starts the class body to the right curly brace that ends the
  class body.  The class static scope is nested within the global
  scope.

  <P > The forms that introduce names into the class static scope are
  the ''static'' annotated forms of //VariableDefinition//,
  //TypeDefinition//, //NamespaceDefinition//, and
  //FunctionDefinition//.  In addition, an //AssignmentExpression// can
  introduce names into a class static scope dynamically.

  <P > The surrounding scope of a function defined in the class static
  scope is that class static scope.


  <LI> The //class instance scope// is defined by multiple disjoint
  pieces of text.  It extends from the left curly brace that starts
  the class body to the right curly brace that ends the class body.
  It also incorporates the class instance scope of its direct
  superclass.  In addition, an //AssignmentExpression// can introduce
  names into a class instance scope dynamically, provided that the
  class has been declared ''dynamic''.

  <P > The class instance scope for a class definition is nested within
  the class static scope for that definition.

  <P > The forms that introduce names into the class instance scope are
  //VariableDefinition// and //FunctionDefinition//.

  <P > The surrounding scope of a function defined in the class
  instance scope is that instance scope; however, the surrounding
  scope of a function inherited from a superclass is the instance
  scope of the class from which it is inherited.


  <LI> The //function scope// covers the body of a function, either
  from the opening left brace of the body to the closing right brace,
  or the expression that makes up the function body in an expression
  closure.

  <P > (That is, types in the signature are resolved in the enclosing
  scope.)

  <P > Since a static initializer block for a class is treated as an
  anonymous function, the function scope extends also from the left
  curly brace of the initializer block through the closing right curly
  brace.

  <P > The forms that introduce names into a function scope are the
  function form itself -- the parameter names are bound in the
  function scope -- as well as instances of //VariableDefinition// and
  //FunctionDefinition// that occur in the body.


  <LI> The //block scope// is introduced by the left curly brace of
  certain source phrases (//Block//, //SwitchStatement//,
  //CatchClause//, //TypeCaseElement//, and //LetBlockStatement//) and
  extends to the matching right curly brace.

  <P > A block scope is also introduced by a binding //ForStatement//
  and extends through the end of that statement's //SubStatement//.

  <P > **Note:** Among these statements, only the //Block// and a
  primitive form of //CatchClause// are fundamental, all the other
  statements can be expressed in terms of these two.

  <P > The forms that introduce names into a block scope are
  //VariableDefinition// and //FunctionDefinition//.
  //LetBlockStatement//, //CatchClause//, and //TypeCaseElement//.
  (However, these forms are not allowed as the direct
  //SubStatements// of a binding //ForStatement//, and the only form
  to introduce a binding into the block scope of a //ForStatement// is
  the statement itself.)


  <LI> The //with scope// is introduced by a //WithStatement// and
  extends through the end of the statement's //SubStatement//.

  <P > New names can be introduced into a with scope dynamically by
  means of //AssignmentExpression//: an assignment that creates a new
  property on the object that the //WithStatement// operates upon
  introduces the name of the property into the with scope.


  <LI> The //expression scope// is introduced by the left parenthesis
  of a //LetExpression//, the name of a named //FunctionExpression//,
  or the left square bracket of an //ArrayComprehension//.  The scope
  extends to the end of the //LetExpression//, the end of the
  //FunctionExpression//, or to the matching right square bracket of
  the array comprehension.

  <P > There are no forms to introduce new names into expression scopes
  except the names introduced by those expression forms themselves:
  the names introduced in the //LetExpression// head, the name of the
  //FunctionExpression//, and the names introduced by ''for'' and
  ''let'' clauses in the //ArrayComprehension//.
  
</UL>

<P> As a rule it is not legal to introduce a particular name in a
particular scope more than once.  (Note that top-level bindings in a
function are bound in the same scope as the function's parameters and
its implicit ''arguments'' parameter.)

<P> However, in "strict" code more than one ''var'' (or ''let'')
binding can introduce a particular name in a particular global,
function, or block scope, provided the two bindings have the same type
annotation (or no annotation at all).  The binding keyword used to
bind the name must be the same in all the binding forms that introduce
the name.  (Parameters and the ''arguments'' object are assumed to be
bound by some system-internal binding form, not ''var'', and duplicate
parameter names are not allowed.)

<P> Additionally, in "standard" mode the following are allowed (in
order to preserve compatibility with the 3rd Edition):

<UL>

  <LI> Parameter bindings and the ''arguments'' binding are assumed to
  be bound as if by ''var'', so duplicate parameter names are allowed,
  as are ''var'' bindings in a function body that bind names that are
  also bound as parameters.  Again, annotations must be the same in
  all bindings of a particular name.

  <LI> Multiple ''var'' and ''function'' forms may bind the same name,
  provided the bindings are all unannotated.
  
</UL>
-->
<!--
=== Notes on derived forms ===

<P> It's probably useful to note (somewhere) the following rewrites.

==== Let blocks ====

<P> Note the double block here that serves to allow the same name on
the lhs and rhs of the = sign, but with two different meanings.


{{{
    let (a=b, c=d) {
        ...
    }

=>  {
        let T1 = b, T2 = d
        {
            let a = T1, b = T2
            ...
        }
    }
}}}

==== Binding for statements ====

{{{
    for ( let i=j ; i < n ; i++ )
        ...

=>  let (T=j) {
        let i;
        for ( i=T ; i < n ; i++ )
            ...
    }
}}}

==== Named function expressions ====

{{{
    var x = function f() { ... }

=>  var x = let (f = function() { ...}) f
}}}

==== Array comprehensions ====

{{{
    [i*j+k for (i in ...) for (j in ...) let (k = ...)]

=>  (function () {
        let i, j, k;
        let T = []
        for (i in ...) {
            for (j in ...) {
                k = ...;
                T[T.length] = i*j+k
            }
        }
        return T;
    })()
}}}

<FIXME> Note that the names are not bound by the ''for'' and ''let''
clauses, this makes a difference if the array initializer expression
captures them.  I suspect that's probably a bug, but it's how Brendan
explained it.

==== Type-discriminating catch handlers ====

{{{
    try { ... }
    catch (n1:T1) { ...n1... }
    catch (n2:T2) { ...n2... }
    catch { ... }

=>  try { ... }
    catch (TMP) {
        switch type (TMP) {
        case (n1:T1) { ...n1... }
        case (n2:T2) { ...n2... }
        case (_:*) { ... }
        }
    }
}}}

==== Switch type ====

{{{
    switch type (x) {
    case (e1:T1) { ...e1... }
    case (e2:T2) { ...e2... }
    }

=>  let (TMP=x) {
        if (x is T1) { ...e1... }
        else if (x is T2) { ...e2... }
    }
}}}

==== Switch with local bindings ====

<P > A switch statement's dependent block is not a block statement but
a grouping construct, so the introduction of a binding inside the
switch statement can be modelled by lifting them into a generated,
surrounding block scope:

{{{
    switch (x) {
    ...
    let i = v
    function f() ...
    ...
    }

=>  {
        let i;
        function f() ...

        switch (x) {
        ...
        i = v
        ...
        }
    }
}}}

-->

== Forward definitions ==

<P> The following kinds of forward definition are available and are
legal on the top level only.  (It would make syntactic sense to allow
forward static ''type'' definitions in classes but since the type
would have to be introduced in the class body anyway it has no(?)
utility.)

{{{
    ns class Cls.&lt;T,...&gt;
    ns interface Iface.&lt;T,...&gt;
    ns type T.&lt;T,...&gt;
}}}


== Initialization ==

<P> There is an order here.  Following is a sketch of how I think it
needs to work.  I haven't yet looked at the reference implementation.

<UL>
  <LI> All names introduced in the scope are defined in the scope.
  Names that would replace existing forward-declared bindings are
  ignored.  Names that would replace existing reserved names cause
  errors to be signalled.

  <LI> Namespace definitions are evaluated in an order such that there
  are no forward references during evaluation.  Circularities cause
  syntax errors.

  <LI> Type definitions, interface definitions, and class definitions
  are evaluated //in that order//, under the following rules.

  <UL>
     <LI> Evaluation of the phrases in a group (types, interfaces,
     classes) takes place in an order such that there are no forward
     references during evaluation of the entity being evaluated.

     <NOTE> Every name referenced in the type expression, interface
     body, or class body must be available at least in the form of a
     forward definition at this point.  Note that evaluating a class
     definition does not cause any program code to be run.

     <LI> Circularities in the inheritance hierarchy or among type
     definitions cause syntax errors.

     <LI> Forward-declared entities are initialized with placeholder 
     objects at the outset.

     <LI> If a definition names a forward-declared name then the 
     definition must match the particulars of the forward declaration 
     (correct kind of definition; correct number of type parameters).

     <LI> If a forward declaration names an existing forward declaration 
     or an existing actual definition then the forward declaration
     must match the particulars of the existing definition.

  </UL>

  <LI> Functions are installed in function bindings, in file
  definition order (per ES3)

  <LI> Variables not also naming functions are given undefined values
  (per ES3)

  <LI> The code in the scope, if any, is run in file definition order.
  This includes running static class initializers for
  non-parameterized classes.

  <P > When any statement with a type annotation is evaluated, all the
  types referenced as annotations must be fully available.  (This
  includes code in static initializers of a class.)

  <NOTE> This means that it's not possible to use forward-declared
  types for annotations except in function bodies and instance bodies.
  It's not clear to me that alternatives make sense, except //maybe//
  where (a) a forward-declared type annotates a variable without an
  initializer or (b) a forward-declared type is used in a top-level
  function signature.  How to implement that?  Don't know yet.  Maybe
  the trick is that the type is "forced" to be ground when a value is
  stored in the property or the function is being called or the
  function's type is being checked, but this can really bite the
  programmer if the implementation is smart and removes run-time type
  checks -- errors may be signalled earlier on some implementations
  than others, therefore programs behave differently on different
  implementations.

  <LI> When the (dynamically) first instance of a class is created
  sometime later the instance template is initialized.  At that point,
  all base classes and all types used by instance methods and instance
  variables must be fully resolved.

</UL>

<P> The static initializer for a parameterized class may be run
multiple times, once for each first instantiation of the class.
Instantiations must be hash-consed; ''Cls.&lt;double&gt;'' denotes the
same class everywhere and the static initializer is only run once.


== VariableDefinition ==

<P> We have ''var'', ''const'', and ''let'' forms.

<P> ''var'' forms are hoisted out of block scopes to the enclosing
global or function scope, so the scope of a ''var'' binding is not the
block but the enclosing global or function scope.  But the initializer
clause, if any, stays put.

<P> ''let'' and ''const'' forms are not hoisted.  Their scope is the
entire block, function, class, or global scope.  But the intializer
clause, if any, stays put.

<P> If a ''let'' or ''const'' bound variable is read before it has
been initialized then a **ReferenceError** is thrown.

<P> A ''const'' bound variable can be written at most once.  A
subsequent write causes a **ReferenceError** to be thrown.


== FunctionDefinition ==

<P> We have the ''function'' and ''const function'' forms.


== NamespaceDefinition ==

<P> A //NamespaceDefinition// introduces an immutable, initialized
binding for a (possibly qualified) name into the global or class
static scope.

<P> (The below is to be replaced by the ASTs eventually.)

<pre>
    ns namespace N1
    ns namespace N2 = N1
    ns namespace N3 = "org.ecmascript.es4"
</pre>

<P> The value of the new binding is a ''Namespace'' object.

<P> If the //NamespaceDefinition// has an initialization clause whose
value is a //PrimaryName// then that name must resolve to a namespace
value at compile time, and the value of the new binding is the same
(in terms of ''==='') as the value of the initialization clause.

<FIXME> For compile-time resolution of namespaces and types, see
chapter 666.


== TypeDefinition ==

<P> A //TypeDefinition// introduces an immutable, initialized binding
for a (possibly qualified) name into the global or class static scope.

<pre>
    ns type T = TypeExpression
    ns type T.&lt;T1,...&gt; = TypeExpression
</pre>

<P> The //TypeExpression// is evaluated in the surrounding scope of
the type definition extended by the type parameters T1 and so on.

<FIXME> What does it mean to evaluate with and without parameters?
What about forward definitions?

<P> The //TypeExpression// must be a compile-time resolvable type
expression, possibly after substituting (?) the type parameters //T1//
in //TypeExpression//.

<FIXME> Substitution certainly not what we're looking for here.
Presumably the chapter on types will have the right notions here.

<P> The value of the new binding is an object implementing the
''reflect::Type'' interface and one of its subinterfaces.  For
example, a type object representing a union type implements the
''reflect::UnionType'' interface.

<P> If the //TypeExpression// is a //PrimaryName// then the value of
the new binding is the same (in terms of ''==='') as the value of the
//TypeExpression//.

<FIXME> In fact, all types are normalized in some sense, so more types
than that are equal and that fact needs to be reflected here.
Presumably that also goes for resolved parameterzed types, but what
about unresolved parameterized types?


== TypeDeclaration ==

<P> A //TypeDeclaration// introduces an immutable, initialized
binding for a (possibly) qualified name into the global scope.

<P> The value of the new binding is an object that represents a
placeholder value for a future //TypeDefinition//.

<P> If there is already a binding for the name in the global scope,
and that binding was introduced by a //TypeDefinition// that is
compatible with this //TypeDeclaration//, then neither a new binding
nor a new value are introduced.  In this case, the //TypeDefinition//
has no effect at all.

<pre>
ns "type" T [.&lt;T1 "," ...&gt;] ";"
</pre>


== InterfaceDefinition ==

<P> An //InterfaceDefinition// introduces an immutable, initialized
binding for a (possibly qualified) name into the global scope.

<P> The binding names a type and it can be used in type annotations
and type expressions, where it matches instances of classes that
implement the interface.

<P> The value of the new binding is an //interface value//: an object
implementing the ''reflect::Type'' interface as well as the
''reflect::InterfaceType'' interface.

<P> If there is already a binding for the name in the global scope,
and that binding was introduced by an //InterfaceDeclaration// that is
compatible with this //InterfaceDefinition//, then neither a new
binding nor a new value are introduced but the //InterfaceDefinition//
is used to complete the placeholder object introduced by the
//InterfaceDefinition// and thereby turn it into an interface value.

<P> Non-normative synopsis (will be replaced by ASTs eventually):

<pre>
ns "interface" I [.&lt;T1 "," ...&gt;] ["extends" I1 "," ...] {
     FunctionDeclaration *
}
</pre>

<P> If the definition of interface //I// has an ''extends'' clause
then the clause must name one or more interfaces.  The interfaces
//I1// and so on are the //superinterfaces// of //I//.  If there is no
''extends'' clause then //I// has no superinterfaces.

<P> If //I// appears (directly or indirectly) as one of its own
superinterfaces then a **TypeError** is thrown.  

<NOTE> For Ch 16: An implementation can detect this error at compile
time and throw a **SyntaxError**.

<P> //InterfaceDefinition// compatibility with //InterfaceDeclaration// ...

<P> Type parameters ...

<P> //FunctionDeclaration//  ...


== InterfaceDeclaration ==

<P> An //InterfaceDeclaration// introduces an immutable, initialized
binding for a (possibly) qualified name into the global scope.

<P> The value of the new binding is an object that represents a
placeholder value for a future //InterfaceDefinition//.

<P> If there is already a binding for the name in the global scope,
and that binding was introduced by an //InterfaceDefinition// that is
compatible with this //InterfaceDeclaration//, then neither a new
binding nor a new value are introduced.  In this case, the
//InterfaceDefinition// has no effect at all.

<pre>
ns "interface" I [.&lt;T1 "," ...&gt;] ";"
</pre>


== ClassDefinition ==

<P> A //ClassDefinition// introduces an immutable, initialized binding
for a (possibly qualified) name into the global scope.

<P> The binding names a type and it can be used in type annotations
and type expressions, where it matches instances of the class.

<P> The value of the new binding is an object implementing the
''reflect::Type'' interface as well as the ''reflect::ClassType''
interface.

<P> Non-normative synopsis (will be replaced by ASTs eventually):

<pre>
ns ["final"]["dynamic"] "class" C [.&lt;T1 "," ...&gt;] ["extends" B] ["implements" I1 "," ...] {
   ( VariableDefinition |
     FunctionDefinition |
     "static" NamespaceDefinition |
     "static" TypeDefinition |
     StaticInitializer ) *
}
</pre>

<P> If the definition of class //C// has an ''extends'' clause then
that clause must name some other class //B//.  The class //B// is said
to be the //superclass// of //C//.  If there is no ''extends'' clause
then the superclass of //C// is the pre-defined class
''public::Object''.  

<P> If //B// does not name a class then a **SyntaxError** is thrown at
definition time.

<P> If //C// appears (directly or indirectly) as its own superclass
then a **TypeError** is thrown.

<NOTE> For Ch 16: An implementation can detect this error at compile
time and throw a **SyntaxError**.

<P> If the definition of class //C// has an ''implements'' clause then
the clause must name one or more interfaces.  These are the
//superinterfaces// of //C//.

<P> If one of the names in the interface list does not reference an
interface then a **SyntaxError** is thrown at definition time.

<P> Constraints on inheritance: no duplicate names; method overrides.

<P> Namespaces: private, protected.

<P> If a class //C// is designated "final" then there can be no class
that names //C// as its superclass.

<P> If a class //C// is designated "dynamic" then new properties may
be added to instances of the class at run-time.

<P> Type parameters.

<P> Constructor.

<P> Prototype object, "__proto__" attribute.


== ClassDeclaration ==

<P> A //ClassDeclaration// introduces an immutable, initialized
binding for a (possibly) qualified name into the global scope.

<P> The value of the new binding is an object that represents a
placeholder value for a future //ClassDefinition//.

<P> If there is already a binding for the name in the global scope,
and that binding was introduced by a //ClassDefinition// that is
compatible with this //ClassDeclaration//, then neither a new binding
nor a new value are introduced.  In this case, the //ClassDefinition//
has no effect at all.
