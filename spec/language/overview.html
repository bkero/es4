== Specification ==

<p>This Standard includes descriptive prose in English as well as code exerpts of a 
definitional interpreter written in the notation of Standard ML. The code provides the
definitive resource for understanding the language where the prose either under
specifies or appears to describe a language that is different than the one described by
the definitional interpreter.

<p>It is our intent that either description is self sufficient and can be read without
knowledge of the other. We recommend that a first reading be focused on the 
prose description. We expect that only the most descriminating users, and implementors, 
will find a need to understand the code in detail.
