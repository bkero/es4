<p>This section defines the mapping from the surface syntax of programs to the abstract
form used to define the semantics of the language.

== Source Text ==

<p>ECMAScript source text is represetned as a sequence of characters in the Unicode character encoding,
version 5 or later. 

== Lexical Structure ==

<p>The source text of an ES program is first converted into a sequence of input elements, which are either
tokens, line terminators, comments, or white space. The source text is scanned from left to right,
repeatedly taking the longest possible sequence of characters as the next input element.

<p>There are two goal symbols for the lexical grammar. The //InputElementDiv// symbol is used in those
syntactic grammar contexts where a division, ''/'', or //division-assignment//, ''/='', operator
is permitted. The //InputElementRegExp// symbol is used in all other syntactic grammar contexts.

<p>Note that contexts exist in the syntactic grammar where both a division and a //RegularExpressionLiteral//
are permitted by the syntactic grammar; however, since the lexical grammar uses the //InputElementDiv// goal
symbol in such cases, the opening slash is not recognised as starting a regular expression literal in such
a context. As a workaround, one may enclose the regular expression literal in parenthesis.

{{{
InputElementDiv ::
    WhiteSpace
    LineTerminator
    Comment
    Token
    DivPunctuator

InputElementRegExpr ::
    WhiteSpace
    LineTerminator
    Comment
    Token
    RegularExpressionLiteral
}}}

=== Tokens ===

{{{
Token ::
    ReservedIdentifier
    ContextuallyReservedIdentifier
    Identifier
    Punctuator
    NumberLiteral
    StringLiteral
}}}

==== ReservedIdentifier ====

<p>//ReservedIdentifier// cannot be used as identifiers.

{{{
ReservedIdentifier :: [one of]
  break case cast catch class const continue debugger default delete do 
  dynamic else false final finally for function if in instanceof interface 
  is let namespace native new null override return static super switch 
  this throw true try type typeof use var void while with yield __proto__
}}}

==== ContextuallyReservedIdentifier ====

<p>//ContextuallyReservedIdentifier//s may be used as property names, but have a special
meaning in the syntactic contexts where they are explicitly referenced in the grammar.

{{{
ContextuallyReservedIdentifier :: [one of]
  each extends generator get implements set standard strict undefined const 
  dynamic each eval extends external final generator get implements 
}}}

=== Identifier ===

<p>Identifiers are interpreted according to the grammar given in //Section ..// of Version 5.0 of
the Unicode standard, with small modifications. The grammar is base on both normative and
informative character categories specified by the Unicode standard.

<pre>
//Identifier// ::
    //IdentifierName// **but not** //ReservedWord//

//IdentifierName// ::
    //IdentifierStart//
 //IdentifierName IdentifierPart//

//IdentifierStart// ::
    //UnicodeLetter//
    **$**
    **_**
    **\** //UnicodeEscapeSequence//

//IdentifierPart// ::
    //IdentifierStart//
    //UnicodeCombiningMark//
    //UnicodeDigit//
    //UnicodeConnectorPunctuation//
    **\** //UnicodeEscapeSequence//

//UnicodeLetter// ::
    ...

//UnicodeCombiningMark// ::
    ...

//UnicodeDigit// ::
    ...

//UnicodeConnectorPunctuation// ::
    ...

//UnicodeEscapeSequence// ::
    ...

//HexDigit// :: [one of]
    **0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f A B C D E F**
</pre>

==== Punctuator ====

{{{
Punctuator :: [one of]
    . .< .. ... ! != !== % %= & &= && &&= * *= + += ++ - -= --
    / /= /> < <= </ << <<= = == === > >= >> >>= >>> >>>=
    ^ ^= | |= || ||= : :: ( ) [ ] { } ~ @ , ; ?
}}}

==== VirtualSemicolon ====

<p>If the first through the n<sup>th</sup> tokens of an ES program form are
grammatically valid but the first through then n+1<sup>st</sup> tokens, then
the parser tries to parse the program again after inserting a //semicolon// (**;**) token
between the n<sup>th</sup> and n+1<sup>th</sup> tokens

==== StringLiteral ====

<p>A string literal is zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes. Each
character may be represented by an escape sequence.

<IMPL>
{{{
StringLiteral ::
    " DoubleStringCharactersOpt "
    ' SingleStringCharactersOpt '

...
}}}

==== NumberLiteral ====

<p>A number literal represents a value of the type //double//.

<IMPL> 
{{{
...
}}}

=== RegularExpression ===

<p>A regular expression literal is an input element that is converted to a RegExp
object (see //section ..: The RegExp class//) when it is scanned. The object is
created before evaluation of the containing program or function begines. ...

<IMPL>
{{{
RegularExpressionLiteral ::
    / RegularExpressionBody / RegularExpressionFlags

RegularExpressionBody ::
    RegularExpressionFirstChar RegularExpressionChars

RegularExpressionChars ::
    [empty]
    RegularExpressionChars RegularExpressionChar

RegularExpressionFirstChar ::
    NonTerminator [**but not** * or \ or /]
    BackslashSequence

BackslashSequence ::
    NonTerminator [**but not** \ or /]
    BackslashSequence

BackslashSequence ::
    \ NonTerminator

NonTerminator ::
    SourceCharacter [**but not** LineTerminator]

RegularExpressionFlags ::
    [empty]
    RegularExpressionFlags IdentifierPart
}}}

<NOTE>Regular expression literals may not be empty; instead of representing an empty
regular expression literal, the characters ''/''''/'' start a single line commment. To specify
an empty regular expression, use ''/(?:)/''.

== Program Structure ==

<p>The semantics of ECMAScript programs is described in terms of an abstract syntax. The major
structure of programs is dominated by several syntactic types:
''BLOCK'',
''DEFINITION'',
''STATEMENT'', and
''EXPRESSION''

<p>A ''BLOCK'' consists of a head that introduces property definitions, and a body that is a ''STATEMENT list''.
Blocks occur in many places in the program syntax including //Programs//, //FunctionDefinitions//, 
//ClassDefinitions//, //InterfaceDefinitions//, //FunctionDefinitions//, //LetExpressions// and various kinds
of statements. Blocks introduce a lexical scope.

<p>A ''DEFINITION'' describes a fixed property. Definitions include //NamespaceDefinitions//, //ClassDefinitions//,
//InterfaceDefinitions//, //TypeDefinitions//, //FunctionDefinitions//, and //VariableDefinitions//.

<p>A ''STATEMENT'' provides one of various control flow constructs.

<p>An ''EXPRESSION'' computes a value. There are serveral sub-categories of expressions. 

<p>A ''TYPE'' is a constant expression that computes a ''TYPE'' value. A constant expression is 
guaranteed to compute the same value over the life of the program. 

<p>A ''NAMESPACE_EXPRESSION'' is a constant expression that evaluates to a ''NAMESPACE'' value.

<p>A ''NAME_EXPRESSION'' has a namespace qualified and unqualified form and evaluates to a ''NAME'' value. 
A ''NAME_EXPRESSION'' that occurs in a compile-time expressions must resolve unambiguously to the name
of a fixed binding.

=== Derived Syntax ===

<p>The surface syntax of ES programs contains some convienence features that can be translated into
other, more primitive, features of the language.


==== Variable initialization inlining ====

<p>Initialised variable definitions are rewritten as uninitialized variable definitions and assignment expressions.

==== Definition hoisting ====

<p>'var' variable definitions are moved to the top of the current function body or program.

<p>'let' and 'const' variable definitions are moved to the top of the current block.

<p>Function definitions are moved to the top of the current block.

==== Destructuring assignment ====

<p>Destructuring patterns are rewritten as a list of atomic assignments

{{{
    [x,y] = z        

=>  let (T=z) x=T[0], y=T[1]
}}}

{{{
    {x=x,y=y} = z      

=>  let (T=z) x=T.x, y=T.y
}}}

==== Let block statements ====

<p>Let block statements are rewritten as nested block statements

{{{
    let (a=b, c=d) {
        ...
    }

=>  {
        let T1 = b, T2 = d
        {
            let a = T1, b = T2
            ...
        }
    }
}}}

==== Binding for statements ====

{{{
    for ( let i=j ; i < n ; i++ )
        ...

=>  { 
        let T=j;
        {
            let i;
            for ( i=T ; i < n ; i++ )
                ...
        }
    }
}}}

==== Named function expressions ====

{{{
    var x = function f() { ... }

=>  var x = let (f = function() { ...}) f
}}}

==== Array comprehensions ====

{{{
    [i*j+k for (i in ...) for (j in ...) let (k = ...)]

=>  (function () {
        let i, j, k;
        let T = []
        for (i in ...) {
            for (j in ...) {
                k = ...;
                T[T.length] = i*j+k
            }
        }
        return T;
    })()
}}}

<FIXME> Note that the names are not bound by the ''for'' and ''let''
clauses, this makes a difference if the array initializer expression
captures them.  I suspect that's probably a bug, but it's how Brendan
explained it.

==== Type-discriminating catch handlers ====

{{{
    try { ... }
    catch (n1:T1) { ...n1... }
    catch (n2:T2) { ...n2... }
    catch { ... }

=>  try { ... }
    catch (TMP) {
        switch type (TMP) {
        case (n1:T1) { ...n1... }
        case (n2:T2) { ...n2... }
        case (_:*) { ... }
        }
    }
}}}

==== Switch type ====

{{{
    switch type (x) {
    case (e1:T1) { ...e1... }
    case (e2:T2) { ...e2... }
    }

=>  {
        let TMP = x;
        {
            if (x is T1) let (e1:T1 = TMP) { ...e1... }
            else if (x is T2) let (e2:T2 = TMP) { ...e2... }
        }
    }
}}}

==== Switch with local bindings ====

<P > A switch statement's dependent block is not a block statement but
a grouping construct, so the introduction of a binding inside the
switch statement can be modelled by lifting them into a generated,
surrounding block scope:

{{{
    switch (x) {
    ...
    let i = v
    function f() ...
    ...
    }

=>  {
        let i;
        function f() ...

        switch (x) {
        ...
        i = v
        ...
        }
    }
}}}
