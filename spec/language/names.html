<SPECNOTE> This introduction is normative but may eventually be moved
into other parts of the specification.

<P> Names in ECMAScript are constants and are comprised of a namespace
value and an identifier.

<P> Names denote types, namespaces, and locations.  The denotation of
a name depends on the context of the name's use: When a name is used
in a type annotation context it denotes a type; when it is used in a
qualifier context it denotes a namespace; and in all other contexts it
denotes a location.

<P> //Unqualified names// are expressed as simple identifiers, for
example ''encodeURI''.  //Qualified names// are expressed as pairs of
namespace expressions and simple identifiers, for example
''intrinsic::substring'' or ''"org.w3.dom"::DOMNode''.

<P> Unqualified names are subject to //name resolution//: every
unqualified name must resolve to a unique qualified name.  Names that
denote types and namespaces are resolved at definition time, while
names that denote locations are resolved (repeatedly) at evaluation
time.

<NOTE> In a qualified name such as ''intrinsic::substring'' the
leftmost identifier, ''intrinsic'', is itself unqualified and subject
to definition-time resolution.

<P> Name resolution makes use of the //open namespaces// that
implicitly qualify any unqualified name.  In every compilation unit
the open namespaces starts out being comprised of the **public** and
**internal** namespaces.  The program can open additional namespaces
by means of the ''use&nbsp;namespace'' pragma.

<P> Name resolution is performed differently depending on whether the
name is a //lexical reference// (for example, the variable reference
''encodeURI'') or a //property reference// on an object (for example,
the reference ''s.substring'').

<P> In the case of a lexical reference a name is resolved as a
reference to a name //bound// in the //scope// of the reference; each
entry in the chain formed by active scope objects binds names to which
the reference may resolve, with resolutions in scopes closer to the
point of reference preferred over those in scopes further away.

<FIXME> "Close" and "far away" are fuzzy / imprecise.

<P> In the case of a property reference a name is resolved as a
reference to a property on a specific object; each entry in the chain
formed by the object and its prototype objects provides named
properties to which the reference may resolve, with resolutions in
objects closer to the original object preferred over those higher up
in the prototype chain.

<FIXME> "Close" and "high up" are fuzzy / imprecise.

<P> Names that denote types, namespaces, and locations are resolved by
the same algorithm.  Suppose an unqualified name denoting a type or
namespace resolves to a particular type or namespace definition in a
particular scope.  Then the same unqualified name denoting a location
will resolve unambiguously to an immutable location that holds a value
that represents the type or namespace, if resolved in the same scope
as the first name.  A reservation mechanism ensures that names that
are resolved at definition time cannot become ambiguous at evaluation
time by the introduction of new bindings.


== Name values ==

<p>A name is a constant value comprised of a namespace value and an
identifier.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="type NAME">

<p>An identifier is a character string.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="type IDENTIFIER">

<p>A namespace value is an immutable object.  A namespace is
//transparent// or //opaque//.  A transparent namespace contains a
character string that identifies the namespace; two transparent
namespaces are equal if and only if their contained strings are equal.
An opaque namespace contains an unforgeable system-generated value
that identifies the namespace; two opaque namespaces are equal if and
only if their contained identifier values are the same object.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="datatype NAMESPACE">
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="type OPAQUE_NAMESPACE_IDENTIFIER">
<INCLUDE file="fixture.sml" name="fun compareNamespaces">

<FIXME> It appears to me that we could simplify here by saying that
opaque namespaces are equal iff they represent the same object.  Are
there SML reasons why that might not work?  Do we not have an
identifier in each object value to make sure that is already possible?


== The namespace <u>public</u> ==

<P> The namespace known as **public** is the transparent namespace
whose identifying string is the empty string.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="name.sml" name="val publicNS">

<NOTE> The **public** namespace is distinguished in several ways.  The
names of properties added dynamically to objects are qualified by
**public** by default, so all properties created by 3rd Edition code
running on a 4th Edition implementation are **public**, and **public**
is sometimes called "the compatibility namespace" for that reason.
The default namespace qualifier that is applied to declarations in
every scope is **public**, so absent other qualification every
property on every object and every lexically bound name is in the
**public** namespace.


== Prototype chain ==

<p>Every object has a distinguished value called its //prototype//
(see section Object prototype in Values).

<p>If the prototype value of an object is another object, then the
prototype value is called an object's //prototype object//, and 
the connection between the initial object and its prototype object
is called a //prototype link//.

<p>The //prototype chain// is the list of objects formed by following
prototype links from an object. The prototype chain of an object
begins with the object itself, and ends with the first object having a
null or undefined prototype value.

<p>When a name is to be resolved against an object, if resolution
initially fails because the object does not contain a property
matching the name, then resolution continues along the object's
prototype chain.

== Scopes and visibility ==

<P> Defining and binding forms introduce names into a program.  These
names can be referenced by name expressions that occur within the
//scope// of the binding.  The scope of a binding is primarily
determined textually (ECMAScript is primarily //lexically scoped//)
and depends also on the defining or binding form that introduced the
binding.

<NOTE> For example, the scope of a ''var'' binding inside a block
statement is the entire body of the function or program containing the
block, whereas the scope of a ''let'' binding inside a block statement
is that block statement.

<P> Scopes nest textually, and a name that is bound in one scope may
be //shadowed// in an inner scope by a binding of the same name in the
inner scope; name expressions in the inner scope will not be able to
access the outer binding.

<P> In this Specification, the nesting of scopes is modelled as a
chain of scope objects, called the //scope chain//.  Each scope object
holds named properties representing the variables bound in that scope.
Every time a new scope is entered the scope chain is extended with a
new scope object, and at every point in the program one particular
scope chain is in effect.

<FIXME> Exhibit the run-time structure for scope chains here.

<P> Some objects that appear on scope chains are dynamically
extensible, in effect providing a form of dynamic scope.  For example,
class objects appear on the scope chain of class and instance methods,
and properties can be added to and removed from class objects; these
properties then become visible and invisible to the methods.

<P> In order for ECMAScript to have a lexically scoped flavor,
bindings that are textually visible (//lexical bindings//) are
preferred over dynamically added bindings (//dynamic bindings//)
during name resolution.


== Name Expressions ==

<p> There are two kinds of name expressions, the unqualified name
(such as ''encodeURI'') and the namespace-qualified name (such as
''intrinsic::subtring'' or ''"org.w3.dom"::DOMNode'').  Name
resolution transforms name expressions into name values.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="and NAME_EXPRESSION">

<p> A qualified name expression is comprised of a namespace expression
and an identifier.  The former is either a literal namespace value
(resulting from using a string as a namespace qualifier) or a name
expression denoting a namespace binding.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="and NAMESPACE_EXPRESSION">

<p> An unqualified name expression is comprised of the namespaces that
are open at the point where the name expression occurs in the source
text and and identifier.  The open namespaces will be used to resolve
the name: an unqualified name matches any binding or property that has
the same identifier and a namespace value from among the open
namespaces.

<p> The open namespaces are represented as a list of sets of namespace
values.  Each set contains namespace values that are given the same
priority during name resolution.  The list holds sets in priority
order.

<NOTE> A new set is added to the list every time a new lexical scope
is entered, and the innermost (highest priority) set is extended by
the ''use&nbsp;namespace'' pragma.  An unqualified name expression
retains a reference to the open namespaces data structure as it appears
at the point where the expression occurs.

<P class="note"> The two lowest priority sets are singleton sets
holding the **public** and **internal** namespaces, respectively.  The
namespace **internal** is specific to each compilation unit.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="mach.sml" name="type NAMESPACE_SET">
<INCLUDE file="mach.sml" name="type OPEN_NAMESPACES">

<FIXME> The use of a ''NAMESPACE list'' here to represents namespace sets
is a spec bug.  Sets should be modelled as set data structures.

<P> The first element on an ''OPEN_NAMESPACES'' list is the highest
priority element.


== Reference Expressions ==

<P> Name expression are incorporated into //reference expressions//
that provide context to the name expression.  Name expressions that
reference names bound in a scope, such as ''encodeURI'' and
''intrinsic::substring'', are contained in ''LexicalReference'' nodes.
Name expressions that reference properties on objects, such as
''s.intrinsic::substring'', are contained in ''ObjectNameReference''
nodes, which reference both the object expression (''s'', in the
example) and the name (''intrinsic::substring'').  Finally, the node
''ObjectIndexReference'' represents computed lookup, such as ''s[e]''.

<SEM>
{{{
datatype EXPRESSION =
         LexicalReference of { name: NAME_EXPRESSION }
       | ObjectNameReference of { object: EXPRESSION,
                                  name: NAME_EXPRESSION }
       | ObjectIndexReference of { object: EXPRESSION,
                                   index: EXPRESSION }
       <LDOTS>
}}}

<NOTE> An ''ObjectIndexReference'' is evaluated by evaluating its
''index'' operand to a ''Name'' object and then treating that value
the same as a resolved qualified name.  Index operands that do not
evaluate to ''Name'' objects are converted to string, and a ''Name''
object is formed from the string and the **public** namespace.


== Name Resolution ==

<p>The evaluation of a name expression depends on where that name occurs. Name expressions that occur
in namespace expressions and type expressions are resolved statically to namespace and type fixtures,
respectively. All other name expressions are resolved to a storage location during evaluation.

<FIXME> we need to talk about ribs (probably when we introduce scopes above). And we need to talk about
how static name resolution operates on ribs and dynamic name resolution operates on scope chains.

=== Namespace and Type Expressions ===

<p>Namespace and type expressions resolve at compile time to namespace and type values, respectively.
Name expressions that occur in either form are resolved using the semantics described here.

<p>Given a list of ribs and a name expression, this algorithm resolves the name
expression to a specific name and fixture in the list of ribs:

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="fixture.sml" name="and resolveNameExpr">

==== Qualified Name Expressions ====

<p>Given a list of ribs, an identifier, and a namespace expression, this algorithm searches for
a rib in the ribs list and a name on that rib that matches the identifier and the 
namespace:

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="fixture.sml" name="fun resolveQualifiedName">

==== Unqualified Name Expressions ====

<p>Given a list of ribs, an identifier, and a list of sets of open namespaces, this algorithm searches for
a rib and a name on that rib that matches the identifier and one of the
open namespaces:

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="fixture.sml" name="and resolveUnqualifiedName">

==== Reserving Names ====

<p>Statically resolved names must keep their meaning at runtime and therefore cannot be shadowed or
be made ambiguous by the later introduction of names. Therefore we reserve the set of names that 
would cause such conflicts at runtime.

<p>Given a name and a list of sets of open namespaces, this algorithm
computes a set of names consisting of the identifier and each of the open namespaces with
an equal or higher priority than the given namespace:

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="fixture.sml" name="and reserveNames">

=== Lexical References ===

<p>Here we describe how a target object and a name are computed from a lexical reference. There
are two kinds of lexical references, unqualified and qualified.

<p>Scope objects contain fixed and dynamic bindings. Fixed names in outer scopes may shadow
dynamic names in inner scopes. For example, a fixed class static name might shadow a dynamic 
instance name. This is necessary to allow early resolution of names. 

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and resolveLexicalReference">

==== Qualified Lexical References ====

<p>Given a scope chain, an identifier, and a namespace expression, this algorithm searches for
an object in the scope chain and a name on that object that matches the identifier and the 
namespace:

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and resolveQualifiedLexicalReference">

==== Unqualified Lexical References ====

<p>If a static name (in a namespace or type expression) resolves to a global name, we reserve
the set of names that consist of the open namespaces with priority equal or higher than the
matched name and the matched names identifier.

<p>Given a scope chain, an identifier, and a list of sets of open namespaces, this algorithm searches for
an object in the scope chain and a name on that object that matches the identifier and one of the
open namespaces:

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and resolveUnqualifiedLexicalReference">

==== Searching a Scope Chain ====

<p>Here we describe how an identifier and a set of namespaces is used to locate an object
and a set of namespaces that match the identifier and a subset of the namespaces.

<p>Maintaining the integrity of names across phases of execution requires that name resolution 
perform two-pass object list search, and that fixed property bindings cannot be shadowed or 
otherwise made ambiguous by dynamic property bindings.

<p>Search each scope object in the scope chain. Perform this search either twice, if necessary.

<p>At first, perform scope chain search with its search restricted to considering only fixed
property bindings on immutable scopes and both fixed and dynamic bindings on mutable scopes.

<NOTE>With scopes and function scopes that might be mutated by 'eval' must be searched fully
during the first pass and ignored during the second pass, to allow shadowing of outer bindings
as is required for backward compatibility.

<p>If the first scope chain search returns no value, repeat the search with its search relaxed 
to include all property bindings, fixed and dynamic, and ignoring any mutable scopes.

Given a scope chain, an identifier and a set of namespaces, this algorithm searches
for an object in the scope chain and a name on that object that matches the identifier and the
open namespaces:

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="mach.sml" name="fun searchScopeChain">

<p>Given a scope, an identifier, a set of namespaces, and a flag indicating if only fixed
bindings are to be considered, this algorithm searches for a name in the scope that matches
the identifier and the set of namespaces:

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="mach.sml" name="fun searchScope">

=== Object References ===

<p>Here we describe how a name is computed from a object reference. There
are two kinds of object references, name and index. Index references are implicitly qualified
by the public namespace. Name references can be either qualified or unqualified.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and resolveObjectReference">

==== Qualified Object References ====

<p>Here we describe how an identifier and a namespace expression is resolved to
a name of a binding on a specfic object.

Given an expression, an identifier, and a namespace expression, this algorithm computes
an object and the name.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and resolveQualifiedObjectReference">

==== Unqualified Object References ====

<p>Here we describe how an identifier and a list of a set of open namespaces
is resolved to a name on a specific object.

Given an expression, an identifier, and a list of open namespace sets, this algorithm searches 
for a name on the object that matches the identifier and the open namespaces.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and resolveUnqualifiedObjectReference">

=== Common Algorithms ===

==== Search an Object  ====

<p>Given an object, an identifier and a set of namespaces, this algorithm searches for a matching
property name.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="mach.sml" name="fun searchObject">

==== Namespace Selection ====

<p>Given an identifier, a list of namespaces, a list of classes, a list of open namespaces, this algorithm
filters the set of namespaces accoring to the order that the namespaces appear in bindings in the given
classes first, and then in the priority given by the list of open namespaces.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="fixture.sml" name="fun selectNamespaces">

===== Class Base Namespace Selection =====

<p>Given a list of classes, an identifier and a set of namespaces, this algorithm selects the
namespaces used on the most generic class of that list. This step is necessary to avoid object
integrity issues that arise when a derived class introduces a binding with the same identifier and a
different namespace in the open namespaces.

<p>**Informal description**: Search this class for any instance fixture name bindings that are 
named by the provided identifier and any of the namespaces in the provided set. Collect the 
set of matching namespaces used in all such bindings. If the set of matching namespaces is 
nonempty, return it. Otherwise repeat the process on the tail of the list, and its tail, 
and so forth down the list. If all the classes in the list are searched and no matching 
namespaces are found, return the empty set.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="fixture.sml" name="fun selectNamespacesByClass">

===== Open Namespace Based Namespace Selection =====

<p>Given a list of sets of open namespaces (ordered from most recently opened to least recently
opened) and a set of matching namespaces, this algorithm returns a subset of the matching set that
occurs entirely within a single open namespace set.

<p>**Informal description**: intersect the head of the provided open namespace list with the
provided set of namespaces. If that intersection is nonempty, return it. Otherwise repeat the
process with the tail of the open namespace list, and its tail, and so forth up through the list of
open namespace sets. If the end of the list of open namespace sets is reached without producing a
nonempty intersection, return an empty set.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="fixture.sml" name="fun selectNamespacesByOpenNamespaces">
