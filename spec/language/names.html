<h1>Names</h1>
<p>
 A name consists of a string and a namespace. Names are introduced into a particular scope by a definition. Those definitions are referred to by names that result from expressions.
</p>
<p>
The qualified forms result in a single name consisting of the given qualifier and identifier. The unqualified forms result in a set of names consisting of strings qualified by the open namespaces.
</p>
<p>
The visibility of an identifier is controlled by the set of open namespaces. The set of open namespaces includes all of the implicitly opened namespaces and the user opened namespaces. The implicitly opened namespaces are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Public namespace</div>
</li> 
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Internal namespace for the current package</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Private namespace for the current class</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Protected namespaces for the current class</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The user opened namespaces are controlled by the use namespace directives that are in scope. For example,
</p>
<pre class="code javascript"><span class="kw2">namespace</span> mx = "http:<span class="co1">%%//%%macromedia.com/mx"</span>
<span class="kw2">use</span> <span class="kw2">namespace</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span>mx<span class="br0">&#41;</span>
o.<span class="me1">m</span><span class="br0">&#40;</span><span class="br0">&#41;</span></pre>
<p>
In this example, the reference to <code>o.m()</code> will involve the names qualified by the namespace <code>mx</code> as well as the implicitly opened namespaces: public, internal, etc.
</p>
<p>
The terms namespace and qualifier are used interchangeably when talking about qualified names.
</p>
<h2>Name definition</h2>
<p>
 A name introduced by a definition must get its namespace from one of various sources 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> top-level definitions in a package have the internal package namespace as their qualifier</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> top-level definitions outside of a package have the file internal namespace as their qualifier</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> interface members have the public namespace as their qualifier</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> dynamic property names have the public namespace as their qualifier</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> definitions inside a class have the internal namespace of the current package as their qualifier, unless a namespace attribute is specified</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a definition with a namespace attribute has its corresponding namespace as its qualifier</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> a definition with an access control attribute has the implicitly defined namespace for that access specifier as its qualifier</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 It is an error to introduce a name with an identifier that has already been defined in an open namespace in the same scope, but with a different qualifier.
</p>
<h2>Reference names</h2>
<p>
 Reference names result from various forms of expressions. The two main distinctions in these forms are whether the name is qualified or unqualified, and whether the identifier is a literal identifier or an expression.
</p>
<p>
The following table shows the kinds of references that include qualified and unqualified, literal and expression names.
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="inline">
        <tr>
                <td class="rightalign">             </td><th class="leftalign"> Literal                </th><th class="leftalign"> Expression                     </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <th> Unqualified </th><td class="leftalign"><code>o.id</code>, <code>id</code>       </td><td class="leftalign"><code>o[expr]</code>                    </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <th class="leftalign"> Qualified   </th><td><code>o.q::id</code>, <code>q::id</code></td><td><code>o.q::[expr]</code>, <code>q::[expr]</code></td>
        </tr>
</table>
<br />
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A qualified or unqualified literal identifier is equivalent to the dynamic form with its expression operand replaced by a string literal representing the literal identifier</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> An unqualified expression reference results in multiple names (called a multiname), one for every open namespace combined with the string value of the expression expr</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> A qualified expression reference results in a qualified name that consists of the value of the qualifier q combined with the string value of the expression expr</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 <em> edit: show examples of multinames </em>
</p>
<h2>Name lookup</h2>
<p>
 An expression involving a name results in an internal reference value used by certain operators to perform actions. To describe name lookup we distinguish between two types of references: those that include a base object (object references), and those that do not (lexical references.) 
</p>
<p>
Looking up a reference involves determining its ultimate qualified name (in the case of unqualified references) and its base object.
</p>
<h3>Object references</h3>
<p>
 Object references result from expressions involving the dot or bracket operators. They may be qualified or unqualified. The following table shows various forms of object references.  
</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" class="inline">
        <tr>
                <td class="rightalign">             </td><th class="leftalign"> Literal     </th><th class="leftalign"> Expression      </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <th> Unqualified </th><td class="leftalign"><code>o.id</code>    </td><td class="leftalign"><code>o[expr]</code>     </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <th class="leftalign"> Qualified   </th><td><code>o.q::id</code></td><td><code>o.q::[expr]</code></td>
        </tr>
</table>
<br />
<p>
 We use the expression form of references to describe the name lookup semantics. However, every literal name can be rewritten as an expression name by the following steps. 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If the expression is an unqualified literal name, then replace the dot operation <code>o.id</code> with a bracket operations of the form <code>o[&#8216;id&#8217;]</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Otherwise the expression is a qualified literal name, so replace the operand of the dot operation with the dot operation <code>o.q::[&#8216;id&#8217;]</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Unqualified object references</h4>
<pre class="code">
o[expr]
</pre>
<p>
This is a reference to a property of the value of the expression <code>o</code> that has a name that matches one of the names of the set of names (multiname) composed in the following way: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>id</code> be the string value of the expression <code>expr</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>m</code> be an empty set of names</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> For each namespace <code>q</code> in the set of open namespaces</div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Let <code>n</code> be a name with the qualifier <code>q</code> and the identifier <code>id</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> Add <code>n</code> to the set of names <code>m</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Return <code>m</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The single name of a multiname reference r is determined by the following steps: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>t</code> be the least derived type of <code>x</code> that contains at least one of the names in the multiname set m of the reference <code>r</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>m&#8217;</code> be the intersection of the set of names <code>m</code> and the property names in <code>t</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>n</code> be the set of names in the most derived type of <code>x</code> and in <code>m&#8217;</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If <code>n</code> is empty, return the name in <code>m</code> that is qualified by the public namespace</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If <code>n</code> contains one name, then return that name</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Report an ambiguous reference error</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The base object of this reference is the value of the expression <code>o</code>.
</p>
<h4>Qualified object references</h4>
<pre class="code">
o.q::[expr]
</pre>
<p>
This is a reference to a property inside the value of <code>o</code> that matches a single name. Because the qualifier is explicit, the qualified name is straightforward to compute. 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>ns</code> be the value of the expression <code>q</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>id</code> be the string value of the expression <code>expr</code></div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Return the qualified name consisting of the namespace <code>ns</code> and the identifier <code>id</code></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The base object of this reference is the value of the expression <code>o</code>.
</p>
<h3>Lexical references</h3>
<pre class="code">
q::[expr]
q::id
id
</pre>
<p>
Lexical references result from expressions involving a name but no base object. Whether a lexical reference is qualified or unqualified, with a literal identifier or expression, it results in a search of the scope chain of the lexical environment until either a match is found or the last scope is searched.
</p>
<p>
The scope chain might include the following kinds of scopes: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Code inside a with statement will have a with frame as the inner most scope on the scope chain</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Code inside a function definition will have an activation object on its scope chain</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Code inside an instance method will have the instance this object on its scope chain</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Code inside of a class definition, including in instance and static methods, will have the class objects of its base classes and the current class on the scope chain. </div>
<ul>
<li class="level2"><div class="li"> The innermost class object corresponds to the most derived class, and the outermost class object corresponds to the Object class</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Code everywhere has the global object as the outermost object on its scope chain</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 The base object of a lexical reference is computed by the following steps: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>s</code> be the list of scopes enclosing the reference being evaluated</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Let <code>n</code> be the qualified name or set of qualified names that result from the operation described in section 4.3.1.1</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Search the scopes in <code>s</code> starting from the innermost scope and continuing outwards until a scope is found that contains a property that matches <code>n</code>, or all scopes have been searched</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> If a match is found, return the scope that contains the matching property</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Report a property not found error</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Intrinsic namespace</h2>
<p>
 <strong>PROPOSAL</strong> &mdash; Please see the <a href="/ECMA/wiki/doku.php?id=proposals:intrinsic_namespace" class="wikilink1" title="proposals:intrinsic_namespace" onclick="return svchk()" onkeypress="return svchk()">Intrinsic namespace proposal page</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
The <code>intrinsic</code> namespace can be used to access a built-in or default function or operator without the risk of being shadowed by a user definition of the same name.
</p>
<h2>Definition Hoisting and Domination</h2>
<p>
 Hoisting is a feature of ES by which a name might reside in  a scope represented by a block outside of the block it is defined in. Except if defined by a &lsquo;let&rsquo; definition, a name is hoisted to the nearest enclosing global, class, or function (regional) scope. Inside of a class, static definitions are hoisted to the implicit class scope, and instance definitions are hoisted to the implicit instance scope.
</p>
<p>
The principle of domination is used to constrain the syntactic location of definitions. A name dominates a point in a program if, before hoisting, there is no path to that point in the program that does not pass through that definition.  
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> class and inteface definitions shall dominate the end of the program</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> configuration names shall dominate the end of the program</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> namespace definitions shall dominate the end of the region</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> class and instance definitions shall dominate the end of the class</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> function definitions shall dominate the end of the region</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> type and let definitions shall dominate the end of the block</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are no domination constraints on var and const definitions.
</p>
<h2>Name resolution</h2>
<p>
Names get resolved at various stages of compilation &ndash; definition,  verification or evaluation. The lexical scope of a name is the region of program text in which that name is visible without reference to the object it lives in. The lifetime of a names is the period in which the name exists and can be reference by any means.
</p>
<h3>Definition Phase</h3>
<p>
Names that get resolved during the definition phase are in scope from the  point of definition to the end of the scope they reside in. Because of  hoisting, the scope a name resides in may be a lexical block outside it point of definition. 
</p>
<p>
Name references in the following syntactic contexts are resolved during the definition phase: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> extends and implements clauses</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> namespace attributes</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> type definitions</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> namespace definitions</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> pragmas</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> configuration attributes (proposed)</div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Verification and Evaluation</h3>
<p>
Names that are resolved during the verification and evaluation phases  are in scope from the beginning of the block they reside in.
</p>
<p>
References in the following syntactic contexts are resolved during verification: 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> type annotations</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> type expressions not in type definitions</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
 All other references are resolved during evaluation.
</p>
