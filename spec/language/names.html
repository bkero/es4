<P>Names in ECMAScript are defined in section ...names.

<P>Names are used to identify properties within property maps and fixtures within fixture maps. 

<P>A name is calculated from a name expression found in ECMAScript source code.

== Name Expressions ==

<p>A //name expresison// is either qualified or unqualified.

<p> A //qualified name expression// consists of a namespace expression and an identifier.  The
former is either a literal namespace value (resulting from using a string as a namespace qualifier)
or else a further name expression identifying a namespace fixture in the lexical environment. Examples
of a qualified names are **intrinsic::subtring** or **"org.w3.dom"::DOMNode**

<p>An //unqualified name expression// consists of an identifier and a list of sets of open
namespaces, determined by context. An example of an unqualified name is **encodeURI**.

<P>An unqualified name is subject to //name resolution//, and must resolve to a unique qualified
name. The algorithm for name resolution is presented in subsequent sections, and differs depending
on the context the unqualified name occurs within. 

<p>Names that are used in contexts denoting types and namespaces must be resolved statically at
definition time. Names that denote other properties may be resolved repeatedly at evaluation time.

<NOTE>In a qualified name such as **intrinsic::substring** the leftmost identifier, **intrinsic**,
is itself unqualified and subject to definition-time resolution.

<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="and NAMESPACE_EXPRESSION">


=== Open namespaces list ===

<p>The //open namespaces list// of an unqualified name expression is a list of sets of namespaces
open at the point of the program where the name expression occurs, and is ordered by priority, with
sets of namespaces earlier in the list taking priority over sets later in the list. The list
reflects the nesting of lexical scopes, with the namespaces opened in the "innermost" lexical scope
held in the first set of namespaces in the list, and subsequent sets holding namespaces opened in
enclosing lexical scopes.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="type NAMESPACE_SET">
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="type OPEN_NAMESPACES">

=== Special namespaces ===

<P>Several namespaces are assigned special meaning, and are generated by an ECMAScript
implementation in specific contexts. 

<P>These namespaces are bound to predefined names and implicitly opened in their associated
scopes. In the following sections, when a namespace is said to be //implicitly opened// in a given
lexical scope, the specified meaning is that a new namespace set is added to the front of the open
namespaces list for the duration of the scope containing the implicitly opened namespaces.

==== Public and 4th Edition namespaces ====

<P>The public and 4th Edition namespaces are defined in section Standard Namespaces of Values, and
are defined identically in all programs and lexical scopes.

<p>The 4th Edition namespace is bound to the global property name **%%""%%::__ES4__** (that is, the name
formed by qualifying the identifier **__ES4__** with the public namespace) and can therefore be seen
by code loaded in either 3rd Edition or 4th Edition mode.

<P>The public namespace is bound to the global property name **__ES4__::public** (that is, the name
formed by qualifying the identifier **public** with the 4th Edition namespace). 

<P>When a program is loaded in 3rd Edition or 4th Edition mode, the public namespace is implicitly
opened.

<P>When a program is loaded in 4th Edition mode, after the public namespace is implicitly opened,
the 4th edition namespace is implicitly opened. The 4th Edition namespace is therefore opened at 
a higher priority than the public namespace.

<NOTE> The **public** namespace is distinguished in several ways. The names of properties added
dynamically to objects are qualified by **public** by default, so all properties created by 3rd
Edition code running on a 4th Edition implementation are **public**, and **public** is sometimes
called "the compatibility namespace" for that reason. The default namespace qualifier that is
applied to declarations in every scope is **public**, so absent other qualification every property
on every object and every lexically bound name is in the **public** namespace.

==== Internal namespaces ====

<P>Each program (compilation unit) has a new implementation-generated opaque namespace implicitly
defined as its //internal namespace// at the start of the definition phase.

<P>The internal namespace for a program is bound to the name **internal** in the global fixture map
for the duration of definition and evaluation. The binding to **internal** is removed after
definition and evaluation of a program, and is re-bound to new internal namespaces for any
subsequent programs loaded.

<P>When a program is loaded in 4th Edition mode, after the 4th Edition namespace is implicitly
opened, the program's internal namespace is implicitly opened. The internal namespace is therefore
opened at a higher priority than the 4th Edition namespace.

<NOTE>An internal namespace can be used to qualify definitions that are not intended to be visible
to any other program.

==== Private and protected namespaces ====

<P>Each class definition has two new implementation-generated opaque namespaces implicitly defined
as its //private namespace// and //protected namespace//.

<P>The private and protected namespaces for a class are bound to the names **private** and
**protected**, respectively, within the lexical scope of the class definition they are associated
with.

<P>The private and protected namespaces for a class are implicitly opened within the lexical scope
of the class.

<P>The protected namespace for a class ''C'' is also implicitly opened within the lexical scope of
//every class that extends ''C''//.

== Reference Expressions ==

<P>A //reference expression// provides context for resolving a name expression to a name, and
identifying a particular fixture or property to which the name refers. A reference expression is
either a lexical reference, an object name reference, or an object index reference.

<p>A //lexical reference// is a reference expression that resolves to a name within a lexical scope,
and therefore a property or fixture stored in a scope object. Some lexical references are required
to be resolved to fixtures statically during program definition, while others may be resolved
dynamically during program evaluation.  Examples of lexical references are **encodeURI** or
**public::Function**.

<P>An //object name reference// is formed by conjoining an object expression and a name expression
with a period ("."). A name expression in an object name reference resolves to the name of a fixture
or property on the provided object, or a fixture or property on the object's prototype chain. Some
object references may be resolved to fixtures statically, but the specified behavior of object
references is as if they are always resolved dynamically during program evaluation. Examples of
object references are **s.length** or **s.intrinsic::substring**, where **s** is the name of an
object.

<P>An //object index reference// is similar to an object name reference, in that it combines an
expression for a name with an object and resolves the calculated name against the provided
object. An object index reference differs from an object name reference by the fact that there is no
proper name expression inside it: rather an object expression is conjoined with a general ECMAScript
expression, enclosed within square brackets, and determining the name to resolve may require
arbitrary evaluation of the bracketed expression. An example of an object index reference is
**s[f()]**, where **s** is the name of an object, and the name to be resolved against **s** is
//calculated dynamically// by evaluating the function expression **f()**. Object index expressions
can therefore never be resolved statically.

<SEM>
{{{
datatype EXPRESSION =
         LexicalReference of { name: NAME_EXPRESSION }
       | ObjectNameReference of { object: EXPRESSION,
                                  name: NAME_EXPRESSION }
       | ObjectIndexReference of { object: EXPRESSION,
                                   index: EXPRESSION }
       <LDOTS>
}}}

<NOTE> An ''ObjectIndexReference'' is evaluated by evaluating its ''index'' operand to a ''Name''
object and then treating that value the same as a resolved qualified name.  Index operands that do
not evaluate to ''Name'' objects are converted to ''string'', and a ''Name'' object is formed from
the string and the **public** namespace.

== Lexical scopes ==

<P>Lexical scopes are defined in section ...scopes. 

<P>Defining and binding forms introduce names into a lexical scope. These names are then visible to
lexical references that occur within the scope of the binding. The scope of a binding is primarily
determined by the textual boundaries of the scope (ECMAScript is primarily //lexically scoped//) and
depends also on the defining or binding form that introduced the binding.

<NOTE>For example, the scope of a **var** binding inside a block statement is the entire body of the
function or program containing the block, whereas the scope of a **let** binding inside a block
statement is that block statement.

<P>Scopes nest textually, and a name that is bound in one scope may be //shadowed// in an inner
scope by a binding of the same name in the inner scope; name expressions in the inner scope will not
be able to access the outer binding.

<P>In this specification, the nesting of scopes is modelled as a list of fixture maps in the
definition phase and a list of objects during evaluation. The former list is called the //static
scope chain// or the //static environment//. The latter list is called the //dynamic scope chain//
or the //dynamic environment//.  Both lists are generically referred to as //scope chains//, with
the distinction between the static and dynamic environments indicated where not otherwise clear from
context.

<P>Each scope holds a fixture map of the named fixtures defined in that scope. 

<P>The fixture maps in the static environment are arranged into a simple list. 

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="and FIXTURE_MAPS">

<P>The fixture maps in the dynamic environment are arranged into accompanying objects, each with a
corresponding property map in which values may be stored as properties.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="mach.sml" name="and SCOPE">
<INCLUDE file="mach.sml" name="and SCOPE_KIND">

<P>At each point in the program, both during definition and evaluation, exactly one scope chain is
in effect. This scope chain is called //the scope chain// or //the environment// containing an
expression, statement or definition.

<P>Some objects that appear on evaluation-time scope chains are dynamically extensible. For
example, class objects appear on the scope chain of class and instance methods, and properties can
be added to and removed from class objects; however, these properties are not visible to lexical
references within the class.

=== Prototype chain ===

<p>Every object has a distinguished value called its //prototype// (see section Object prototype in
Values).

<p>If the prototype value of an object is another object, then the prototype value is called the
object's //prototype object//, and the connection between the initial object and its prototype
object is called its //prototype link//.

<p>The //prototype chain// is the list of objects formed by following prototype links from an
object. The prototype chain of an object begins with the object itself, and ends with the first
object having a null prototype value.

<p>When a name is to be resolved against an object, if resolution initially fails because the object
does not contain a property matching the name, then resolution continues along the object's
prototype chain.


== Name Resolution ==

=== Overview ===

<P> The purpose of name resolution is to take an unresolved name and a
list of objects and return an unambiguous name (consisting of a
namespace value and an identifier) and an object that contains a
property with that name.  The objects are searched in order, and the
first object to contain a property with the name is selected.

<!--
<P> There are three complications.  First, the search is performed
differently for object chains (an object and its prototypes) and scope
chains.  An object chain is searched in a single pass and each
object's fixed and dynamic properties are considered when the object
is searched.  A scope chain, on the other hand, is searched in two
passes, with the first pass considering mainly fixed properties and
the second pass considering also dynamic properties.  (The search ends
as soon as an object matching the name is found, so the second pass
may never be run.)  Thus fixed properties in outer scopes shadow
dynamic properties in inner scopes.  However, for reasons of
compatibility with ES3, the first pass searches both dynamic and fixed
properties in scopes that are introduced by the ''with'' statement or
in scopes that have been extended by the ''eval'' operator evaluating
a ''function'' or ''var'' directive.

<P>(The motivation for giving priority to fixed bindings in scopes is
to retain the lexically scoped flavor of ECMAScript.  Some of the
objects on the scope chain--class objects and instance objects--are
dynamically extensible, and allowing dynamic properties to shadow
static properties would make programs harder to understand, and it
would make them slower, as it would be hard to perform early binding.)
-->

<P> There are two complications. The first appears with the need for disambiguation.
When an unqualified name is resolved the resolution is performed in
the context of the namespaces that were open at the point of
reference.  Thus the search of any one object may find multiple
bindings that match the name, up to one binding per open namespace.
Instead of making this an error, the name resolver disambiguates by
trying to select the most desirable of those namespaces.  Selection is
performed by filtering the applicable namespaces until we are left
with one.  (If we have more than one then the name is deemed
ambiguous.)

<P> We first select those namespaces among the matching namespaces
that are in use by the least specific class of the object that
contains the name.  For example, if ^^C^^ is a subclass of ^^B^^ and
^^B^^ is a subclass of ^^A^^, and our name ^^n^^ matched ^^ns1::n^^,
^^ns2::n^^, and ^^ns3::n^^, and ^^ns1::n^^ and ^^ns2::n^^ were defined
in ^^B^^ and ^^ns3::n^^ was defined in ^^C^^, then we'd be left with just
^^ns1^^ and ^^ns2^^.

<P> (The motivation for using the order in which names are introduced
in the class hierarchy is to guarantee that the meaning of valid references
to object properties doesn't change. In other words, if **o.x** is ever
valid, then it shall always refer to the same property **x** as long as the type
of **o** doesn't change.)

<P> We then filter by namespace priority.  The open namespaces are
organized in a prioritized list of namespace sets.  If one of the
matching names has a namespace that is from a set with a higher
priority than all the other matching names, then that's the namespace
we want.  So if the referencing context of ^^n^^ opened ^^ns2^^ in a
scope nested inside the one that opened ^^ns1^^, then we are left with
just ^^ns2^^ -- and a single binding, ^^ns2::n^^.

<P> (The motivation for disambiguation by the scope in which a namespace
is opened, is simple: it allows more programs to run.  Furthermore, since 
the priority of namespaces during disambiguation is under the control of 
the programmer, the programmer can rely on disambiguation to control which
names are found.)

<P> The second complication is that some names are required to be
resolved successfully at definition time -- names that denote
namespaces and types.  (We require definition-time resolution in order
to make names and types constant, which generally simplifies the
language and makes programs more easily comprehensible.)  The
consequence is that namespace and type references are illegal inside
scopes introduced by **with** or scopes that may be extended by the
**eval** operator, because those scopes make definition time
resolution impossible -- their contents are unknown.  Such programs
result in a syntax error being signalled.  (It is possible to ease
that restriction in various ways but we have not done so.)

<P> However, we also require that type and namespace names that are
resolved at definition time must resolve to the same bindings that
they would resolve to if they were to be resolved at evaluation time.
(We require that because it simplifies the user's model of the
language: equal names in the same scope have the same meaning,
provided they resolve at all.)  The consequence is that the language
must provide protection against ambiguities that can be introduced at
a later time.  If a name is resolved at definition time to a global
binding then compilation units loaded later may introduce new global
bindings that will make the resolved binding ambiguous.  For example,
consider the following program.

{{{
namespace NS1
namespace NS2
NS1 type T
use namespace NS1, namespace NS2

   ... var x: T
}}}

<P> The reference to **T** in the type annotation is resolved uniquely
at definition time to **NS1::T**.  Then another compilation unit is
loaded:

{{{
NS2 type T = ...
}}}

<P> Since the global environment is "flat"--code in earlier
compilation units can see bindings introduced by later compilation
units--the reference to **T** from the first program is now ambiguous.

<P> ES4 protects against this eventuality by //reserving// global
names that are resolved at definition time.  When **T** is resolved in
the first program and found to be in **NS1**, the name **NS2::T** is
reserved: it is made off-limits to later programs.  As a consequence,
the second program above would not be loaded, because the introduction
of **NS2::T** would be an error.

<P> Names are reserved in namespaces at the same or higher priority
level as the namespace that the name was resolved to, so in the
example above neither **public::T** nor **internal::T** would become
reserved, as those namespaces are at lower priority levels than
**NS1** and **NS2**.

<NOTE> Top-level "use&nbsp;namespace" pragmas are given a higher
priority level than names originating "outside" the compilation unit,
as is the case for **public** and **internal**.


=== Definition-Time Resolution of Namespace and Type Expressions ===

<P> The definition time scope chain is modelled as a list of fixture maps, defined elsewhere.  A fixture map
maps names to fixture bindings that result from defining and binding forms (**var**, **function**,
**type**, **class**, **interface**, **namespace**, and others).  Fixture maps have no dynamic properties.

<P> Definition time resolution resolves name expressions that denote
namespaces and types, and performs reservation of global names if
necessary.

<p> The following algorithm resolves a name expression to a specific
name and fixture in the list of fixture maps.

==== Qualified Name Expressions ====

<p> A qualified name expression is resolved by resolving the namespace
part and then returning the tail of the list of fixture maps such that the
first fixture map on the tail contains a binding for the name.

<NOTE> The name can't be ambiguous because there is only one namespace.

==== Reserving Names ====

<p> Statically resolved names must keep their meaning at runtime and
therefore cannot be shadowed or be made ambiguous by the later
introduction of names.  Therefore we reserve the set of names that
would cause such conflicts at runtime.

<p> Given a name and a list of sets of open namespaces, the following
algorithm computes a set of names consisting of the identifier and
each of the open namespaces with an equal or higher priority than the
given namespace.

<FIXME> Obviously we need more prose here.  Also we want to be sure
to note that reservation only happens in the global object.

=== Evaluation-time Resolution of Lexical References ===

<P> The evaluation time scope chain is modelled as a list of arbitrary
objects.  A scope object maps names to properties (both fixtures and
dynamic properties).  Apart from scope objects introduced by the
**with** statement, the evaluation time scope chain mirrors the
definition time scope chain.

<p> The following algorithm resolves a name expression to an object
and the name of a property on that object.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and resolveLexicalReference">

==== Qualified Lexical References ====

<p> To resolve a qualified lexical reference we evaluate its namespace
expression (it must yield a namespace value) and then look up the name
comprised of the namespace value and the qualified reference's
identifier.  If a binding is not found then we return the global
object, otherwise the object that contained the binding for the name.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and resolveQualifiedLexicalReference">

==== Unqualified Lexical References ====

<p> To resolve an unqualified lexical reference we make use of the
full algorithm outlined above, finding the first object that maches
the unqualified name in all open namespaces and then disambiguating
the set of resulting namespaces.

object, in a single pass over the prototype chain.

<p> ''ObjectIndexReference'' expressions represent computed lookup.
The index expression is computed; if it evaluates to a **Name** object

==== Disambiguation by Filtering ====

<p> Given an identifier, a list of namespaces, a list of classes, a
list of open namespaces, the following algorithm coordinates the
filtering of the set of namespaces: according to the order that the
namespaces appear in bindings in the given classes first, and in the
priority given by the list of open namespaces second.

===== Class Base Namespace Filtering =====

<p> Given a list of classes, an identifier and a set of namespaces,
the following algorithm selects the namespaces used on the most
generic class of that list. This step is necessary to avoid object
integrity issues that arise when a derived class introduces a binding
with the same identifier and a different namespace in the open
namespaces.

<p> **Informal description**: Search a class for any instance fixture
name bindings that are named by the provided identifier and any of the
namespaces in the provided set. Collect the set of matching namespaces
used in all such bindings. If the set of matching namespaces is
nonempty, return it. Otherwise repeat the process on the next instance
fixture map.  If all the classes in the list are searched and no matching
namespaces are found, return the empty set.

===== Open Namespace Based Namespace Filtering =====

<p> Given a list of sets of open namespaces (ordered from most
recently opened to least recently opened) and a set of matching
namespaces, this algorithm returns a subset of the matching set that
occurs entirely within a single open namespace set.

<p> **Informal description**: intersect the head of the provided open
namespace list with the provided set of namespaces. If that
intersection is nonempty, return it. Otherwise repeat the process with
the tail of the open namespace list. If the end of the list of open
namespace sets is reached without producing a nonempty intersection,
return an empty set.
