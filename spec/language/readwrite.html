== Topics ==

Assume: we have an object and want to read or write a property on it.

- uninitialized checking (a read barrier)
- non-nullable types with non-default values read from array holes (a read barrier)
- type checking (a write barrier)
- read-only names (a write barrier, modified by strict mode)
- getters and setters (read and write barriers)
- catchall getters and setters (read and write barriers, since getter may be
  invoked even if the object exists in the proto chain)
- catchall protocol in general

== Getting ==

<P> The following algorithm is different from the RI as follows.

<UL>
<LI> The RI gives precedence to existing dynamic props over catchalls,
     but that is wrong.

<P> Wrinkles not incorporated:

<UL>
<LI> "Upgrading" from type or namespace value (maybe others?) to full objects
<LI> Native properties

{{{
fun get property(obj, name, isStrict, virtualOK) {
  if (name is a property on the property list of obj && 
      obj is not a getter/setter pair && 
      the isFixed attribute of obj.name is true)
    if obj.name is a method then
      return a new closure where 'obj' is bound as 'this' to the method extracted from obj.name
    return the value of obj.name

  if (virtualOK && 
      meta::get is a property on the property list of obj && 
      the isFixed attribute of meta::get is true)
    try 
      invoke meta::get on obj, passing name
    catch DefaultBehavior
      get property(obj, name, isStrict, false)
    return

  if name is a property on the property list of obj
    if obj.name is a getter/setter pair
      invoke the getter, this=obj
      return its result
    return obj.name

  cantHappen // actually, meta::has lied, so throw an error
}
}}}

<P> The full lookup algorithm has the following wrinkle.  If the obj
itself and the prototype chain did not contain the property, then the
following code is run:

{{{
  if the dynamic attribute on obj is true
    if the dynamic type constraint has a default value
      return that default value

  return undefined  // maybe not in strict mode??
}}}

== Setting ==

<P> The following algorithm is different from the RI in several ways.

<UL>
<LI> the RI gives precedence to existing dynamic props over catchalls
<LI> the RI throws an error in standard mode if trying to overwrite
     method fixtures, but here it fails silently (by design)
</UL>

<P> Wrinkles not incorporated:

<UL>
<LI> natives
</UL>

== Some archaeology ==

eval.sml:getValueOrVirtual() 

  Retrieves a named property from an object.  It throws errors if the
  property is uninitialized.  It invokes the getter or the catchall
  getter if it's there.  It binds a method if the property extracts a
  method from a class instance.  It reifies 'arguments' (yow!).

  It may be buggy, looks like eg a global 'meta const function get()',
  which is probably legal, won't be invoked.

  called from getValue; native.sml:get()  -- what the latter does is
  mysterious but it disallows the use of catchalls.  It's intrinsic::get
  in the global object.  Looks like a holdover from the old days?

  Seems likely that the full catchall protocol has not been implemented.

  The way this is structured, the function is passed a fallback
  handler that it invokes if the property is not found, so there is no
  notion of returning success or failure.  Really, it's CPS.

  Unfortunately, hasOwnProperty and [[HasProperty]] do not use the
  same kind of protocol; they will not invoke catchalls.  That's a
  bug.



eval.sml:getValue()

  The only customer in this file of getValueOrVirtual.  Performs the
  prototype chain search.  Determines whether a lookup throws an error
  or not (as when not finding a prop in a non-dynamic object).


eval.sml:setValueOrVirtual()

  Ditto.  

  We need to decide if the asymmetry here should be kept, it throws
  when writing to R/O method props but not when writing to R/O value
  props.

  Needs to know about strict code for when it writes to R/O props.
