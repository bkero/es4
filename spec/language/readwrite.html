= Reading and Writing Properties =

<P> This chapter describes the algorithms for //property access//:
testing objects for the presence of a property, reading from and
writing to a property, and removing a property.  Property access is
always by the name of the property.  A property name is represented
either as an instance of the pre-defined class **Name**, or as a
**string** (which represents a name in the **public** namespace).

<SPECNOTE> This chapter complements the chapter on names, scopes, and
name resolution.  At this time, there is some overlap between the two
chapters.

<P> Property accesses are subject to run-time checks, and property
access fails (an exception is thrown) if a check does not pass.  The
exact exception depends on the particular check.

<NOTE> For example, a property created by **let** or **const** or a
property whose type is a non-nullable type without a default value
must be written (initialized) before it is read; properties created by
**const** cannot be written more than once; and properties that have
type annotations can be updated with a new value only if the allocated
type of the new value is a compatible subtype of the storage type of
the property.  A **ReferenceError** is thrown in the first two
instances, and a **TypeError** is thrown in the last.

<P> A property may be virtual, that is to say, the reading and writing
of the property may be implemented by //getter// and //setter//
methods on the object, and an expression that is syntactically a
reference to the property is in fact an invocation of these methods.
Virtual dynamic properties may be implemented by //catch-all//
methods.

<FIXME>We need a definition of "method", this is the first use.

== Catch-All Methods ==

<P> This section contains a normative overview of the catch-all
facility.  A more precise, also normative, description is given in
later sections of this chapter, as part of the general description of
property access.

<SPECNOTE> Any conflicts between the two descriptions are obviously bugs.

<P> Objects may contain fixtures in the **meta** namespace: **meta::get**, **meta::set**,
**meta::has**, and **meta::delete**.  These properties always name methods.  Jointly they are known
as //catch-all methods//.

<NOTE> The requirement that the **meta** properties always name
methods must be checked by the language implementation.  The namespace
**meta** is reserved and known to the implementation and may only be
used in specific circumstances.  See section (...).

<P> If a catch-all method is defined on the object then it is invoked when a dynamic property is
accessed: **meta::has** is invoked to determine if the object has the property; **meta::get** is
invoked to read the property's value; **meta::set** is invoked to update or create the property; and
**meta::delete** is invoked to delete the property.  A catch-all method is invoked even if the
dynamic property that is being accessed already exists on the object.

<P> A catch-all method operates on the receiver object of the method
call, not on the receiver's prototype objects.

<P> If a catch-all method returns normally then the value it returns (if any) becomes the result of
the property access, possibly after being converted to a canonical type.

<P> If a catch-all method throws an exception, and the exception
thrown is an instance of the pre-defined class
**DefaultBehaviorClass**, then the default behavior for the catch-all
is triggered.

<P> **DefaultBehaviorClass** is a singleton class; its only instance
is is stored in the global constant **DefaultBehavior**.

<NOTE> The mechanism is analogous to the one defined for iterators,
where an instance of the singleton **iterator::StopIterationClass** is stored in
the global property **iterator::StopIteration**.

<P> The **meta::get** method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  The value returned is the property value.  The default behavior
for **meta::get** is to retrieve the value from a dynamic property in
the object's property map.

<P> The **meta::set** method is invoked on two arguments, a property
name and a value.  Any value returned is ignored.  The default
behavior for **meta::set** is to update or attempt to create a dynamic
property in the object's property map.

<P> The **meta::has** method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  Any value returned by the method is converted to **boolean**.
The default behavior for **meta::has** is to search for a dynamic
property in the object's property map.

<P> The **meta::delete** method is invoked on one argument, a property
name.  Any value returned by the method is converted to **boolean**.
The default behavior for **meta::delete** is to attempt to delete a
dynamic property from the object's property map.

== Checking for the Presence of a Property ==

<P> The ''HasOwnProperty'' protocol is invoked to check whether an object //obj// contains a
property named by //name//.

<SPECNOTE> In terms of the 3rd Edition Specification, the
''HasOwnProperty'' protocol implements the test for whether an object "has
a property", as used in the implementations of [[Get]], [[Put]],
[[HasProperty]], and other internal subroutines.

<P> An object is said to contain a property if the property is in the
object's property map or if the **meta::has** catchall claims the
property to be present.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and hasOwnProperty">

<NOTE> The ''regs'' parameter represents the virtual machine state.  The
operator ''&lt;*'' tests subtype compatibility.

== Reading a property value ==

<P> The ''GetPropertyValue'' protocol is invoked to read the value of a
property named by //name// from an object //obj//.  The flag
//isStrict// is true if the ES4 code that caused GetProperty to be
invoked was compiled in strict mode.

<P> Specifically, there will be an AST node for the property reference
whose ''strict'' flag is set because it represents a source code
phrase that was recognized in a region of code that was covered by a
strict mode pragma.

<SPECNOTE> There may be several types of AST nodes carrying strict flags and invoking
''GetPropertyValue'', depending on how the AST is eventually structured.

<FIXME>Strict mode is not implemented in this code.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and getPropertyValue">
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and getPropertyValueOrVirtual">


<NOTE> A bound method has identity, so if **m** is a method on the
class of some object **o** then the expression **o.m** always
evaluates to the same object value (in terms of **===**).


== Writing a property value ==

<P> The ''SetProperty'' protocol is invoked to write a value //value// to
a property named by //name// on an object //obj//.  The object may or
may not have a property of that name when SetProperty is invoked, and
SetProperty may attempt to create the property.  The flag //isStrict//
is true if the ES4 code that caused SetProperty to be invoked was
compiled in strict mode.

<P> Specifically, there will be an AST node for the property update
whose ''strict'' flag is set because it represents a source code
phrase that was recognized in a region of code that was covered by a
strict mode pragma.

<FIXME>Strict mode is not implemented in this code.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and setPropertyValue">
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and setPropertyValueOrVirtual">
<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="and writeProperty">

<FIXME> We must take into account the [[CanPut]] functionality from ES3!


== Deleting a property ==

<P> The ''DeleteProperty'' protocol is invoked to remove a property named
by //name// from an object //obj//.  The object may or may not have a
property of that name when DeleteProperty is invoked.  The flag
//isStrict// is true if the ES4 code that caused DeleteProperty to be
invoked was compiled in strict mode.

<P> Specifically, there will be an AST node for the property deletion
whose ''strict'' flag is set because it represents a source code
phrase that was recognized in a region of code that was covered by a
strict mode pragma.


<FIXME>Strict mode is not implemented in this code.
