== Value Expressions ==

A value expression has the concrete syntax of //ThisExpression//, //LetExpression//, ..., 
and the abstract form of //LiteralExpr//, //ListExpr//, //LexicalRef//, //ObjectRef//,
//LetExpr//, //TerneryExpr//, ....

This expressions can be modified by an optional keyword: ''generator'' or ''function''. 
The modifier indicates whether the expression refers to the current this object, 
generator or function.

=== Conditional Expressions ===

<p>A conditional expression has the concrete syntax of //ConditionalExpression//

 It is evaluated by the function //evalCondExpr// as 
invoked by the function //evalExpr//.

=== Set Expressions ===

<p>A //set expression// has the concrete syntax of //AssignmentExpression// such as
the simple form:

{{{
    x = y
}}}

and the compound form:

{{{
    x += y
}}}

<p>The current value of the property being assigned is modified by the value on the
right side and the binary operation specified. In the case of the simple assignment
operation, the value of the left side property is replaced with the value on the 
right side.
