<FIXME> Cross-check with normative grammer on terminology, etc
<FIXME> Double-check that the specification and implementation of the
subtype relation are consistent.

<p>ECMAScript includes a gradual type system that supports optional
type annotations on properties (e.g., on variables and fields).  These
type annotations are currently enforced dynamically.

<p>Every value has an //allocated type//. The allocated type is the
type given to a value when it is created and which defines its fixed
structure. 

<p>Every property has a //storage type//. The storage type of a
property is given by its declaration and constrains the set of values
that can be stored in the property. The storage type of a property is
also called the property's //type constraint//.

<p>The declarations of properties can carry type //annotations//,
which define the storage type of the property. Annotation is denoted
by following the annotated property name with a colon and a type
expression. Annotations are not required: any property lacking an
annotation is implicitly given the storage type ^^*^^, meaning that
the property can hold a value of any allocated type.

<p>If a property holds a value, then that value must have an allocated
type that is a //compatible subtype// of property's storage type. The
compatible subtype relation is an extension of the traditional subtype
relation that supports interoperation between typed and untyped code.
The definition of the compatible subtype relation is included below.

<p>For a given type ^^T^^, a set of values is said to //populate//
^^T^^ if the values all have allocated types that are compatible
subtypes of ^^T^^. Some types are specified by specifying the values
that populate them.

== The Type Language ==

<p>ES4 includes the following types:

=== The any type ===

<p>The //any type// is the type populated by every possible value. In
other words, every other type is a compatible subtype of the any type.

<p>The any type is denoted in a type expression as ^^*^^.

<p>No value has the any type as its allocated type. The any type
is meaningful only as the storage type of a property.

=== The null type ===

<p>The //null type// is the type populated only by the ^^null^^ value.

<p>The null type is denoted in a type expression as ^^null^^.

=== The undefined type ===

<p>The //undefined type// the type populated only by the value stored in
the global constant ^^public::undefined^^. 

<p>The undefined type is denoted in type expressions as ^^undefined^^.

=== Nominal types ===

<p>A //nominal type// is either a class type or an interface type.

<p>A //class type// is a type defined by a class definition. 

<p>An //interface type// is a type defined by an interface definition.

<p>Nominal types are arranged in an explicit subtype relation through the use of ^^extends^^ and
^^implements^^ clauses in class and interface definitions.

<p>A nominal type is denoted in type expressions by the name of the class or interface that defined
the type.

=== Record types ===

<p>A //record type// is a subtype of the ^^public::Object^^ class
type that has additional type constraints on some specific set of
named properties.

<p>Record types are arranged implicitly into a subtype relation
through structural comparison of their property constraints.

<p>A record type is denoted in a type expression by listing the names
of the specified properties in a comma separated list, with optional
type annotations, enclosed in curly braces.

<p>An example is ^^{x: Number, y: String}^^, which denotes a record
type with two properties ^^x^^ and ^^y^^, the first constrained to
type ^^Number^^ and the second to type ^^String^^. The type ^^{ }^^
denotes the empty record type.

=== Array types ===

<p>An //array type// is a subtype of the ^^public::Array^^ type that
has type constraints on some prefix of the set of all possible
unsigned-integer-indexed properties. An array type may be either
//fixed-length// or //variable-length//.

<p>Array types are arranged implicitly into a subtype relation through
structural comparison of their property constraints.

==== Fixed-length array types ====

<p>A //fixed-length array type// describes an explicit set of initial
integer-indexed property constraints that must be satisfied by properties
found at those indices. 

<p>A fixed-length array type is denoted in a type expression by
listing the types of the specified properties in a comma-separated
list enclosed in square brackets.

<p>For example, the type ^^[Number, String]^^ describes fixed-length
arrays of length at least 2, where the entry at index 0 has type
^^Number^^ and the entry at index 1 has type ^^String^^.

<p>The type ^^[ ]^^ describes fixed-length arrays of length at least
0, that is, it describes all fixed-length arrays.

<FIXME> Do we need to discuss holes here?

==== Variable-length array types ====

<p>A //variable-length array type// describes an explicit set of
initial integer-indexed property constraints and then a //final
constraint// that is implied for any further integer-indexed
properties (including zero further properties).

<p>A variable length array type is denoted, initially, the same way a
fixed-length array is, but concludes its type list with symbol ^^...^^
and a trailing type expression.

<p>For example, the type ^^[Number, ... String]^^ describes arrays of
length at least 1, where the entry at index 0 has type ^^Number^^, and
any remaining entries have type ^^String^^. The type ^^[ ... Number]^^
describes arrays of zero or more elements, all of which must be of
type ^^Number^^.

=== Union types ===

<p>A //union type// is a storage type that is populated by all values
that populate all of the types that make up the union.

<p>A union type is denoted in a type expresison by listing the types of 
the union members, separated by the vertical-bar character, enclosed 
in parentheses.

<p>For example, the type ^^(Number | String)^^ denotes a type that is
populated by both ^^Number^^ and ^^String^^ values. A property
annotated with this type can therefore hold either instances of the
^^Number^^ type //or// instances of the ^^String^^ type.

<p>No value has a union type as its allocated type. Union types
are only meaningful as the storage types of properties.

=== Function types ===

<p>A //function type// is a subtype of the ^^public::Function^^ type
that describes additional type constraints on any function populating
it.

<p>A function type describes the number and type of required
parameters, any optional parameters, any trailing "rest" parameter
that accumulates excess arguments, and the return value.

<p>Function types are denoted with the keyword ^^function^^, followed
by a parenthesis-enclosed, comma-separated list of parameter types --
optionally including default and rest symbols -- and an optional colon
and trailing return type. 

<p>An example of a function type is:

**
{{{
    function (Number, String) : String
}}}
**

<p>This function type is populated by any function that is declared as
taking a ^^Number^^ value and a ^^String^^ value as parameters, and
returning a ^^String^^ value.

<p>The return type of a function type can be omitted, in which case
the return type is implicity the any type.

<p>If a function should not return a value, the function return type
can be annotated as ^^void^^, which is a notation for defining return
types of function types only; there is no separate "void type" that
can be denoted elsewhere. 

<p>A function type may include a type constraint for the ^^this^^
binding. Such a constraint must be listed as the first parameter in 
the function type parameter list, and must be denoted with the keyword
^^this^^ and a colon. For example, the function type

**
{{{
    function(this : Number, String) : String
}}}
**

denotes a type of functions that require a ^^Number^^ value as their
implicit ^^this^^ parameter, as well as taking a ^^String^^ argument and
returning a ^^String^^. The type constraint for the ^^this^^ binding
defaults to the any type ^^*^^ if omitted.

<p>A function type may denote the presence of default value
assignments for some suffix of its parameter types by annotating the
types of such parameters with trailing ^^=^^ symbols. For example, the
function type

**
{{{
    function(Number, String=) : String
}}}
**

denotes a type of function that takes a mandatory ^^Number^^ argument
and an optional second ^^String^^ argument, and returns a ^^String^^. 

<p>A function type may denote the presence of a trailing
"rest-argument" with the symbol ^^...^^ in the final position of the
function parameter list. This final parameter, if present, indicates
that there is no maximum number of arguments to the function:
additional arguments beyond the parameter list are collected into an
array object and passed to the function. For example, the function
type

**
{{{
    function(String, ... ) : String
}}}
**

denotes a type of function that takes a ^^String^^ and any number of
additional arguments (of any type), returning a ^^String^^. Rest
arguments cannot have type constraints.

<p>Function types can optionally include a parameter name preceding
each argument type, and separated from that type by a colon. These
parameter names are for documentation purposes only. For example, the
type of a ''substring'' function might be specified as:

**
{{{
    function(str : String, start : double, end : double ) : String
}}}
**

=== Nullable types ===

<p> A //nullable type// is an abbreviation for a union between some 
type and the null type.

<p>A nullable type is denoted ^^?T^^ for some type ^^T^^.

<p>For example, the nullable type ^^?String^^ is an abbreviation for
the union type ^^(String | null)^^. 

<p>Nullable types are purely a syntactic convenience, and are not
given further special treatment.


=== Non-null types ===

<p> A //non-null type// is a type that excludes the ^^null^^ value from the population of a nullable
class or interface type.

<p>A non-null type is denoted ^^!T^^ for some class or interface type ^^T^^.

<p>For example, the non-null type ^^!String^^ is populated by instances of ^^public::String^^ but
//excludes// null values.

=== Parametric types ===

<p>A //parametric type// is a user-defined //type constructor// -- not
a proper type -- associated with some fixed definition such as a
class, interface or type definition. A parametric type takes some
number of types as arguments and produces a new type as its result.

<p>Parametric types are denoted by appending a type-parameter list to
the name of a class, interface, or type at the site of its
definition. A type parameter list consists of a single period, a
less-than (or "left angle bracket") character, a comma-separated list
of identifiers, and a greater-than (or "right angle-bracket")
character.

<p>For example, the class definition

**
{{{
    class Vector.&lt;X&gt; { .. }
}}}
**

defines a class ^^Vector^^ that is parameterized over a single type
variable ^^X^^. This class therefore also serves as a parametric type
that can be used in type applications to form proper types.


=== Type applications ===


<p>A //type application// is a combination of a parametric type with a
set of //type arguments// that serve to //instantiate// the parametric
type into a proper type that can be populated by values.

<p>A type application is denoted by appending a type-argument list to
the name of a parametric type. A type argument list consists of a
single period, a less-than character, a comma-separated list of type
expressions, and a greater-than character.

<p>For example, the type application ^^Vector.&lt;Number&gt;^^ denotes an
class type that can be used as the allocated type of new objects.


=== Type names ===

<p>A //type name// is a symbolic reference to a class, an interface, a
type definition, or a type variable bound by a parameter in a
parametric type.

<p>A type name is denoted in a type expression by the same syntax as
a name expression. 

<p>Type names are resolved during //type resolution//, described in
Section 3.4.1 below.

== Semantics of the Type Language ==

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="and TYPE">
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="and FUNCTION_TYPE">
<INCLUDE file="ast.sml" name="type NONCE">

To help avoid name collisions, each type variable bound in a type
parameter list is assigned a unique integer, or //nonce//.
Any reference to that type variable is then resolved
into a ''TypeName'' that includes that nonce.

== The Subtype and Type Equivalence Relations ==

=== The Subtype Relation ===

<p>The //subtype relation// is a binary relation on types.  It is
defined by the collection of subtype rules described below and in the
following subsections.

<p>
Subtyping is reflexive, so every type is a subtype of itself.

<p> Subtyping is transitive, so if ^^S^^ is a subtype of ^^T^^
and ^^T^^ is in turn a subtype of ^^U^^, then ^^S^^ is
also a subtype of ^^U^^.

=== Implementation of the Subtype Relation ===

<p> The subtype relation is defined by the following function
''subType''.  This function takes an additional argument called
''extra'', which is later used to extend the subtype relation with
additional rules (for example, to define the compatible-subtyping
relation below).

<p>Reflexivity is included explicitly in the code below, whereas
transitivity is a consequence of the remainder of the algorithm.
This function dispatches to additional subtype functions
described in the following subsections.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="fun subType">

=== The Type Equivalence Relation ===

<p>The type equivalence relation is also a binary relation on types.
Two types are equivalent if and only if they are both subtypes of each other.

==== Implementation of the Type Equivalence Relation ====

The function ''equivType'' below checks type equivalence in a
straightforward manner by checking subtyping in both directions. Like
''subType'', ''equivType'' also takes an ''extra'' parameter.

<IMPLNOTE>The following implementation is straightforward and sufficies
for a specification, but its worst-case time complexity is exponential
in the height of a type, and so this naive approach would be
inadequate in an implementation.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and equivType">

=== Subtyping Record Types ===

<p> A record type ^^{N_{1}:S_{1}, .., N_{n}:S_{n}}^^ (where each
distinct ^^N_{i}^^ is a name and each ^^S_{i}^^ is a type) is
a subtype of ^^{N_{1}:T_{1}, .., N_{m}:T_{m}}^^ if m <LEQ> n and
^^S_{i}^^ is equivalent to ^^T_{i}^^ for all i in 1..m.

<p> The ordering of the ^^Name:Type^^ bindings in a record type is
irrelevant, and so re-arranging these bindings yields an equivalent
type.  In particular, this re-arranging may be necessary in order to
make the above rule applicable. The function ''nameExpressionEqual''
checks if two field names are equal.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and subTypeRecord">
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="fun nameExpressionEqual">


=== Subtyping Array Types ===

<p> A fixed-length array type ^^[S_{1}, .., S_{n}, S]^^ is a subtype of
^^[S_{1}, .., S_{n}]^^.  The supertype demands one fewer element in the
array than the subtype does.  For example, ^^[Number, String,
String]^^ is a subtype of ^^[Number, String]^^.

<p> A fixed-length array type ^^[S_{1}, .., S_{n}]^^ is a subtype of ^^[T_{1},
.., T_{n}]^^ if each ^^S_{i}^^ is equivalent to ^^T_{i}^^ for i in 1..n.

<p> A variable-length array type ^^[S_{1}, .., S_{n}, S, ... S]^^ is a
subtype of ^^[S_{1}, .., S_{n}, ... S]^^.  The supertype demands one fewer
element in the array than the subtype does.  For example, ^^[Number,
String, String, ... String]^^ is a subtype of ^^[Number,
... String]^^, via transitivity.

<NOTE>Since ^^...^^ denotes concrete syntax, we use the
 //meta-syntax// ^^S_{1}, .., S_{n}^^ to denote a sequence of
 zero-or-more comma-separated types.

<p> A variable-length array type ^^[S_{1}, .., S_{n}, ... S]^^ is a subtype
of ^^[T_{1}, .., T_{n}, ... T]^^ if ^^S^^ is equivalent to ^^T^^ and if each
^^S_{i}^^ is equivalent to ^^T_{i}^^ for i in 1..n.

<p>Via transitivity, the above rules may be applied multiple times, in
various combinations. The following code combines all of these rules
into a single deterministic algorithm for array subtyping.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and subTypeArray">

=== Subtyping Union Types ===

<p> A union type ^^(S_{1} | .. | S_{n})^^ is a subtype of a type ^^T^^ if
^^S_{i}^^ is a subtype of ^^T^^ for all i in 1..n.

<p> A type ^^S^^ is a subtype of ^^(T_{1} | .. | T_{n})^^ if
there exists some i in 1..n such that ^^S^^ is a subtype of ^^T_{i}^^.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and subTypeUnion">


=== Subtyping Function Types ===

<p> A function type ^^function(S_{1}, .., S_{n}) : U^^ is a subtype of
^^function(T_{1}, .., T_{n}) : R^^ if ^^U^^ is a subtype of ^^R^^ and ^^S_{i}^^ is
equivalent to ^^T_{i}^^ for all i in 1..m.

<NOTE> Function subtyping is invariant in the argument position, and
covariant in the result type.

<p> This rule generalizes to ^^this^^ arguments, default arguments,
and rest arguments according to the following rule, where the number
of default arguments (indicated via the ^^=^^ symbol) in each function
type may be zero, and where ^^[...]^^ indicates an optional rest
argument.  A function type

**
{{{
    function(this:S_{1}, S_{2}, .., S_{n}, S_{n+1}=, .., S_{m}=, [...]) : U
}}}
**
is a subtype of
**
{{{
    function(this:T_{1}, T_{2}, .., T_{p}, T_{p+1}=, .., T_{q}=, [...]) : R
}}}
**

if ^^U^^ is a subtype of ^^R^^ and n <LEQ> p and ^^S_{i}^^ is equivalent
to ^^T_{i}^^ for all i in 1..min(q,m). In addition:

<UL>
  <LI>If neither function type  has a rest argument, then we require that  q <LEQ> m.

  <LI>If only the first function type has a rest argument, then no
additional conditions are needed.

  <LI>If only the second function type has a rest argument, then
  subtyping does not hold.

  <LI>If both function types have a rest argument, then ^^S_{i}^^ must be
equivalent to the any type ^^*^^ for all i in (q+1)..m.

</UL>

<p>
For generic functions, alpha-renaming of the type variable preserves
the meaning of types.  Moreover,

**
{{{
    function.&lt;X_{1},..,X_{n}> (argtypes1) : R1
}}}
**
is a subtype of
**
{{{
    function.&lt;X_{1},..,X_{n}> (argtypes2) : R2
}}}
**

if and only if

**
{{{
    function(argtypes1) : R1
}}}
**
is a subtype of
**
{{{
    function(argtypes2) : R2
}}}
**

Hence, to check subtyping between generic functions, we alpha-rename
the type variables to be identical in both types, and then proceed to
check subtyping on the non-generic versions of the two function types.

<p> The types in a subtype relation may contain free type variables,
which are assumed to denote the same unknown type in both arguments to
the subtype relation. For example, within the scope of a binding for a
type variable ^^X^^, the type ^^[X, ... X]^^ is a subtype of the type
^^[ ... X]^^.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and subTypeFunction">

<P> The following function ''rename'' performs the capture-free
substitution of references to any of the identifiers in
''typeParams1'' with references to the corresponding identifier in
''typeParams2'' in the type ''ty''.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="fun rename">



=== Subtyping Non-Null Types ===

<p>A non-null type ^^!S^^ is a subtype of type ^^T^^
if ^^S^^ is a subtype of the union type ^^(T | null)^^.

<p>A type ^^S^^ is a subtype of a non-null type ^^!T^^
if ^^S^^ is a subtype of ^^T^^
and the type ^^null^^ is //not// a subtype of ^^S^^.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and subTypeNonNull">

=== Subtyping Nominal Types ===

<p>
Given a class definition

**
{{{
    class C extends D implements I_{1}, .., I_{n} { ... }
}}}
**

the class type ^^C^^ is a subtype of class type ^^D^^, and class type ^^C^^ is also a subtype of
interface type ^^I_{j}^^ for j in 1..n.


<p>
Given an interface definition

**
{{{
    interface K extends I_{1}, .., I_{n} { ... }
}}}
**

the type ^^K^^ is a subtype of ^^I_{j}^^ for j in 1..m.

<p>These rules generalize to applications of generic classes and interfaces via
appropriate renaming of bound variables. For example, given a generic
class definition

**
{{{
    class C.&lt;x_{1}, .., x_{n}> extends D.&lt;T_{1}, .., T_{m}> { ... }
}}}
**

we have that ^^C.&lt;S_{1}, .., S_{n}>^^ is a subtype of

**
{{{
    D.&lt;T_{1}[x_{1}:=S_{1},..,x_{n}:=S_{n}], .., T_{m}[x_{1}:=S_{1},..,x_{n}:=S_{n}]>
}}}
**

<p>Also,
^^C.&lt;T_{1}, .., T_{n}>^^ is a subtype of
^^C.&lt;S_{1}, .., S_{n}>^^ if each type ^^T_{i}^^ is equivalent to the
corresponding type ^^S_{i}^^ for i in 1..n.

<NOTE>
The notation ^^T[x_{1}:=S_{1},..,x_{n}:=S_{n}]^^ denotes the type ^^T^^ with each
occurrence of the type variable ^^x_{i}^^ replaced (in a capture-free
manner) by the corresponding type ^^S_{i}^^.

<NOTE> The above rules also apply if ^^C^^ is declared as a
non-nullable class.

<NOTE> There is a distinction between the type name ^^C^^ and the
class type to which it refers, in that the type name ^^C^^  includes
the type ^^null^^ if ^^C^^ is a nullable type, whereas the class type
^^C^^ describes only class instances.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and subTypeNominal">

The following function ''substTypes'' performs the capture-free
replacement of all occurrences of ''typeParams'' by ''typeArgs''
within the type ''ty''.

<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="fun substTypes">

=== Relating Structural and Nominal Types ===

<p> A record type ^^{N_{1}:S_{1}, .., N_{n}:S_{n}}^^  is a subtype of the class
type ^^public::Object^^.

<p> An array type ^^[S_{1}, .., S_{n}]^^  is a subtype of the class
type ^^public::Array^^.

<p> Any function type  is a subtype of the class
type ^^public::Function^^.

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and subTypeStructuralNominal">

== Type Normalization ==

<P> At run-time, when a type ^^T^^ is encountered in the source program,
that type is immediately //normalized//. Type normalization consists
of two phases: //type resolution// followed by //type
canonicalization//.

=== Type Resolution ===

<p> Type resolution on a type ^^T^^ proceeds as follows:

<p>
In the scope of a type definition

**
{{{
    type X = S
}}}
**

any reference to a type variable ^^X^^ in ^^T^^
is replaced by the type ^^S^^.

<p>
In the scope of a generic type definition

**
{{{
    type X.&lt;y_{1}, .., y_{n}> = S
}}}
**

a type application ^^X.&lt;S_{1}, .., S_{n}>^^ in ^^T^^ is
replaced by the type ^^S[y_{1}:=S_{1}, .., y_{n}:=S_{n}]^^.
  
<p> In the scope of a class definition that associates a
non-nullable class name ^^C^^ with a class definition ''D'',
type resolution replaces any ''TypeName'' that refers to ^^C^^ with
''ClassType D''. For references to a nullable class, the same
replacement is made, but the result (or the enclosing ''AppType''
node, if there is one) is unioned with the ^^null^^ type. 

<p> Similarly, in the scope of an interface definition that associates
an interface name ^^I^^ with an interface definition ''D'', type
resolution replaces any ''TypeName'' that refers to ^^I^^ with
''InterfaceType D'' (again, unioned with the ^^null^^ type, if ^^I^^
is a nullable interface).


--- old ---
=== Subtyping Nullable Nominal Types ===


<p>A nominal type ^^C^^ (or ^^C.&lt;T_{1}, .., T_{n}>^^) can be
declared as a //non-null// type via any of the following declarations:

**
{{{
    class C! ..
    class C.&lt;X_{1}, .., X_{n}>! ..
    interface C! ..
    interface C.&lt;X_{1}, .., X_{n}>! ..
}}}
**

<p>A nominal type is //nullable// if it is not a non-null type.

<p>The type ^^null^^ is a subtype of any nullable nominal type. 

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="and subTypeNullable">


==== Implementation of Type Resolution ====

<p>The following function ''resolveTypeNames'' performs type
resolution on a particular type ''ty'' in the context of an
environment ''env''.

<p>This function relies on the auxiliary function
''Fixture.resolveNameExpr'' (described in section ...) to resolve each
type name. The function ''Fixture.resolveNameExpr'' returns the
corresponding fixture (as the third component of the result triple),
plus the environment that fixture was defined in, and the
fully-resolved name for the given name expression.

<p> If the resulting fixture is for a non-parametric type definition,
the body of that type definition is resolved in its 
environment, and then replaces the original type name.

<p> If the resulting fixture is for a class or interface definition,
the type name is replaced by a class type or an interface type
(unioned with the type ^^null^^ if the nominal type is declared as nullable).

<p> A type application that refers to a type-parametric type
definition is replaced by the body of that type definition, after the
replacement of each formal parameter name with the corresponding
resolved type argument.

<p> A type application of a type name that refers to a type-parametric
class or interface definition is replaced by a type application that
directly includes that class or interface type (unioned with the type
^^null^^ if the nominal type is declared as nullable).

<p> If none of the above cases apply, then ''resolveTypeNames'' uses
the helper function ''mapType'' to perform type name resolution on
each sub-term of the given type.

<p>The function ''error'' reports error messages, and the module
''LogErr'' contains functions for converting various data structures
into corresponding Strings.

<FIXME>Is the "LogErr." prefix too verbose on calls to error?

<SEM>
<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="fun resolveTypeNames">

<INCLUDE file="type.sml" name="fun mapType">


=== Type Canonicalization ===

<FIXME> If canonicalization results in a normalized type, why is the
process not called normalization?

<p>Each type ^^T^^ is considered equivalent (under the equivalence
relation defined above) to some collection of types. The process of
//type canonicalization// converts a type in the program source code
into a canonical or representative element of its equivalence class.
In particular, if two types ^^T_{1}^^ and ^^T_{2}^^ are equivalent,
then canonicalization will convert them both into an identical
normalized type.

<p>This canonicalization process is necessary to efficiently
support type-parametric classes.

<p>The type canonicalization code is not presented here.

=== Normalized Types ===

<p>A //normalized type// is one that is the result of the preceding
normalization process.

<p>Normalized types do not include:

<UL>
  <LI> type names that refer to nominal types (''ClassType'' and ''InterfaceType'' are used instead)
  <LI> type names that refer to type  definitions (which are inlined)
</UL>
  
<P> Normalized types may include type names that refer to generic type
parameters; these references include a nonce.
  
== Compatible Types ==

<p>The compatibility relation is a binary relation on type values. Two
types ^^S^^ and ^^T^^ are compatible if ^^T^^ can be obtained from
^^S^^ by replacing certain portions of ^^S^^ by the any type ^^*^^.

<p>For example, the record type ^^{x : double}^^ is compatible with
both ^^{x : *}^^ and with ^^*^^, but the type ^^{x : *}^^ is not
compatible with ^^{x : double}^^.

<P> Also, ^^T.&lt;Number>^^ is compatible with ^^T.&lt;*>^^.

<p>This compatibility relation is reflexive and transitive, but not
symmetric.

== Compatible-Subtyping ==

<p>The compatible-subtype relation is a binary relation on types.  A
type ^^S^^ is a compatible-subtype of a type ^^T^^ if there exists
some type ^^U^^ such that ^^S^^ is a subtype of ^^U^^ and ^^U^^
compatible with ^^T^^.

<p>For example, the record type ^^{x : double, y : boolean}^^ is a
compatible-subtype of the types ^^{x : *, y : *}^^, ^^{x : double}^^,
^^{x : *}^^, and ^^*^^.

<p>The compatible-subtyping relation is reflexive and transitive, but not symmetric.

<p>The compatible-subtyping relation is implemented by calling the
previously-defined ''subType'' predicate and passing in an ''extra''
parameter that reasons about compatibility, in that every type is
compatible with ^^*^^.

== Type Invariants at Run Time ==

<p>A type is //reifiable// if it is not the any type or a union type.

<p>Every value in ES has an associated //allocated type//, which is a type that is
associated with the value when the value is first allocated or created. An allocated
type is always a reifiable type. The allocated type of a value is invariant; for example,
updating the fields of an object cannot change the allocated type of that object.

<p>If a property of storage type ^^T^^ hold a value ^^v^^ of type
^^S^^, then ^^S^^ is a compatible-subtype of ^^T^^.
