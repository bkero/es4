== Synopsis ==

<P> A new expression form ''assert'' is introduced.  Assert
expressions simplify invariant checking in programs and allow programs
to request reification of debugging information.


== Syntax ==

<P> There are two forms of the ''assert'' expression.

{{{
    "assert" "(" AssignmentExpression ")"
    "assert" "(" AssignmentExpression "," AssignmentExpression ")"
}}}

<P> The ''assert'' expression is a new //PrimaryExpression//.  The
identifier ''assert'' is contextually reserved.

<NOTE> The parentheses in the expression are not optional, easing the
porting of many programs that already use a single-argument ''assert''
function to provide similar (but simpler) functionality.

== Semantics ==

<P> The expression ''assert(E)'' evaluates //E// to //v// and converts
//v// to a boolean //b//.  If //b// is **true** then the result of the
''assert'' expression is //v//.  Otherwise, an **AssertionError** is
thrown.

<NOTE> The class ''AssertionError'' is a new subclass of ''Error''.
See [2].

<P> The expression ''assert(E1,E2)'' evaluates //E1// to //v1// and
converts //v1// to a boolean //b//.  If //b// is **true** then the
result of the ''assert'' expression is //v1//.  Otherwise, E2 is
evaluated to yield a new value //v2//, which is thrown.


== Debugging information extraction ==

<P> When an assertion expression throws an exception value //v// and
//v// is an instance of a subclass of the pre-defined class ''Error'',
then the run-time system should record information about the source
location of the assertion failure in the appropriate fields of //v//.
See [2].

<NOTE> The intent is that the ''context'' and ''backTrace'' fields of
the error object are given values that reflect the name or origin of
the program source and the line number within that source where the
assertion expression occured.  However, ES4 may not require that the
implementation support the recording of that information.
