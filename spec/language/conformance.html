<p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must provide and support all the types, values,
objects, properties, functions, and program syntax and semantics described in this specification.

<p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript shall interpret characters as code points drawn from
the Unicode Standard, Version 4.0 or later, and ISO/IEC 10646:2003, which specify identical code
points. The encoding form of characters is unspecified. 

<p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript is permitted to provide additional types, values,
objects, properties, and functions beyond those described in this specification. In particular, a
conforming implementation of ECMAScript is permitted to provide properties not described in this
specification, and values for those properties, for objects that are described in this
specification.

<p>A conforming implementation of ECMAScript is permitted to support program and regular expression
syntax not described in this specification. In particular, a conforming implementation of ECMAScript
is permitted to support program syntax that makes use of the "future reserved words" listed in
section REF of this specification.
