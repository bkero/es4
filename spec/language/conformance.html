= Conformance =

A conforming implementation of ECMAScript must provide and support all
the types, values, objects, properties, functions, and program syntax
and semantics described in this specification.

A conforming implementation of this International standard shall
interpret characters as code points drawn from the Unicode Standard,
Version 4.0 or later, and ISO/IEC 10646:2003, which specify identical
code points. The encoding form of characters is
unspecified. Characters shall be normalized to Unicode normalization
form C, canonical composition, as described in Unicode Standard Annex
#15.

A conforming implementation of ECMAScript is permitted to provide
additional types, values, objects, properties, and functions beyond
those described in this specification. In particular, a conforming
implementation of ECMAScript is permitted to provide properties not
described in this specification, and values for those properties, for
objects that are described in this specification.

A conforming implementation of ECMAScript is permitted to support
program and regular expression syntax not described in this
specification. In particular, a conforming implementation of
ECMAScript is permitted to support program syntax that makes use of
the “future reserved words” listed in section REF of this
specification.
