== Synopsis ==

<P> The purpose of the present spec is to define what it means for a
property of an object to be "enumerable", that is, what it means for
the property to be discovered when the properties of an object are
enumerated by ''for''-''in'' and ''for''-''each''-''in'' loops [4].

<P> This spec also describes in high level terms the facilities that
are available to user programs to implement variations on enumeration.


== Enumeration and itemization in ES4 ==

<P> According to [1], enumeration and itemization in ES4 is specified
in terms of the new iterator protocols using a system-defined helper
class called ''Enumerator''.  A section below contains a brief
description of how the translation is performed.  The central point is
that enumeration is implemented by an ''Enumerator'' instance.

<P> The constructor of
''Enumerator'' optionally takes some namespace values:

{{{
    iterator class Enumerator.&lt;T&gt; {
        public function Enumerator(obj, f, deep, ...namespaces) {
            ...
        }
        public function next(): T {
           ...
        }
    }
}}}

<P> An ''Enumerator'' created on an object //obj// will produce (from
its ''next'' method) a succession of the enumerable properties of
//obj//: those dynamic properties of //obj// whose "enumerable"
attribute [2] is set, filtered by the contents of //namespaces//.  If
//deep// is true, then the objects in the prototype chain of //obj//
are included in the enumeration.  Enumeration is always performed
starting at //obj//; properties are produced in the order they were
inserted into //obj// [3]; when the properties in //obj// are
exhausted the process is repeated on the immediate prototype of
//obj//, if any.

<P> There is a distinct namespace in ES4 known as the "compatibility
namespace" or "no namespace".  In code, this namespace is denoted by
the keyword ''public''.

<P> When an ''Enumerator'' is created with an empty set of namespaces,
it filters the enumerable attributes by the compatibility namespace,
and all property names produced are ''string'' values -- the property
name without the namespace, because the namespace is always the
compatibility namespace.

<P> When an ''Enumerator'' is created with a nonempty set of
namespaces, it filters the enumerable attributes by those namespaces
only, and all property names produced are ''Name'' values: namespace
and name pairs.

<P> (Punchline.)  Normal enumeration and itemization by the
''for''-''in'' and ''for''-''each''-''in'' loops result in the
creation of ''Enumerator'' instances with an empty sets of namespaces
and //deep// set to **true**.  Ergo, normal enumeration behaves as in
ES3.

<P> Programs that needs to enumerate properties in specific
namespaces, or that only need to perform shallow enumeration, can
create custom ''Enumerator'' classes.  It is possible that ES4 ought
to provide utility functions to make this simple, but experimentation
will show.


== Rationale and discussion ==

<P> The rephrasing of enumeration in terms of iteration allows the
''for''-''in'' and ''for''-''each''-''in'' statements to be used for
iteration, which is exceptionally handy.

<P> Regarding namespace filtering and enumeration by default of only
public properties: Namespaces are used by user programs for privacy
and integrity.  For example, the ''private'' attribute on properties
and methods of a class is just the name of a system-generated
namespace.  It would be a breach of privacy for arbitrary code to be
able to enumerate arbitrary properties on an object, since the private
property names would be revealed in the form of ''Name'' objects, from
which the private namespace could be exposed.  Yet it is useful for
code to enumerate properties in namespaces controlled by that code.
So the compromise -- which is also right for compatibility with ES3 --
is that only public properties are enumerated by default; all
system-provided namespaces can be obtained by naming them (a class
method can evaluate the expression ''private'' to obtain the object
representing its private namespace); and custom ''Enumerator''
instances can be constructed to enumerate names in namespaces other
than the public.

<P> The reason for not enumerating fixture properties is that this
fits in well with a certain style of programming.  Consider constructing
a prototype object:

{{{
    Func.prototype = const { toString: function () ..., 
                             myMeth: function () ... }
}}}

<P> The methods ''toString'' and ''myMeth'' are meant to be prototype
methods, hence not enumerable.  But they are in the public namespace,
and therefore enumerable by default.  However, the lock-down by the
''const'' prefix -- making them fixtures -- is taken as a signal that
they are not "normal" public properties.  Hence it's probably right
not to enumerate them.



== Primer: Translating enumeration into iteration ==

<P> For the full story, go to [1].

<P> The loop that is written like this in ES3:

{{{
    for (i in o)
        ...
}}}

has this meaning in ES4:

{{{
    let IT = iterator::GET(o, true);
    while (true) {
        try {
            i = IT.next();
        }
        catch (e : iterator::StopIterationClass) {
            break;
        }
        ...
    }
}}}

<P> In the preceding fragment, ''IT'' is a fresh variable, ''iterator::GET''
is a system-supplied function shown below, and
''iterator::StopIterationClass'' is a class type.  Both of the latter are
considered unforgeable (local rebindings do not shadow the original
meanings we consider here).

<P> The function ''GET'' and its auxiliary ''DEFAULT_GET'' are defined
as follows:

{{{
    iterator const function GET(start: !Object, deep: boolean): iterator::IteratorType.&lt;*&gt; {
        if (start like iterator::IterableType.&lt;*&gt;)
            return start.iterator::get(deep);
        else
            return iterator::DEFAULT_GET(start, deep);
    }

    iterator const function DEFAULT_GET(start: !Object, deep: boolean = false): iterator::IteratorType.&lt;(string|Name)&gt;
        new Enumerator.&lt;(string|Name)&gt;(start,
                                       function (id: (string|Name), obj: !Object): (string|Name) { return id },
                                       deep);
}}}

<P> In other words, if the object ''o'' is iterable -- if it provides
its own iterator -- then its own iterator is used to control the loop,
otherwise the default behavior is invoked.  It is the default behavior
that interests us here since it implements the ES3 enumeration and
itemization protocol.

<P> The default behavior, implemented by DEFAULT_GET, creates a new
''Enumerator'' instance, and this instance behaves in the way outlined
earlier in this document.

<P> The behavior for ''for''-''each''-''in'' itemization is similar.
