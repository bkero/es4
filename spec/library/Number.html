<P> ECMAScript provides a variety of primitive number representations.
They are primitive in the sense that these are the representations
directly operated upon by the operators of the language, and also in
the sense that they are represented by final non-dynamic classes for
which ECMAScript implementations may provide efficient
representations.

<P> The class ''int'' represents signed 32-bit integer values in the
range -2<sup>31</sup> to 2<sup>31</sup>-1 inclusive.

<P> The class ''uint'' represents unsigned 32-bit integer values in
the range 0 to 2<sup>32</sup>-1 inclusive.

<P> The class ''double'' represents 64-bit IEEE-format binary floating
point numbers approximately in the range -1.7976931348623157 <TIMES>
10<SUP>308</SUP> to +1.7976931348623157 <TIMES> 10<SUP>308</SUP>.

<P> The class ''decimal'' represents 128-bit IEEE-format decimal
floating point numbers in the range
<NOBR>-(10<SUP>34</SUP>-1) <TIMES> 10<SUP>6111</SUP></NOBR> to
<NOBR>(10<SUP>34</SUP>-1) <TIMES> 10<SUP>6111</SUP></NOBR>.

<COMP> The 3rd Edition of this Standard provided only one kind of
primitive number value, represented as 64-bit IEEE-format binary
floating point.

<P> ECMAScript also provides the class ''Number'', which is a dynamic
non-final class that represents 64-bit IEEE-format binary floating
point numbers.  Instances of ''Number'' are converted to
''double'' when operated upon by the operators ofthe language.


<H2 id="type Numeric"> The type ''Numeric'' </h2>

<P> The type ''Numeric'' is a union type that contains all the number
types in the language.

<INCLUDE file="Numeric.es" name="intrinsic type Numeric">

<FIXME> (Ticket #181.)  The type ''Numeric'' should instead be called
''Numbers''.


<H1 id="class Number"> The class ''Number'' </h1>

<P> The class ''Number'' is a dynamic, nullable, non-final direct
subclass of ''Object'' that holds a ''double'' value.  Instances of
''Number'' are converted to ''double'' when operated upon by the
operators of the language.

<P> All intrinsic methods of ''Number'' obtain the number value stored
in the object by calling the intrinsic ''valueOf'' method.  If the
class ''Number'' is extended then the extending class can override the
intrinsic ''valueOf'' method in order to provide new ways of
representing the number value stored in the class.

<P> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method is not constrained to return a
''double'' value, it can return any primitive number type.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Number'' provides the following interface:

{{{
dynamic class Number
{
    <SIGNATURE file="Number.es" name="function Number">
    <SIGNATURE file="Number.es" name="meta static function invoke">
    
    static const MAX_VALUE: double = double.MAX_VALUE
    static const MIN_VALUE: double = double.MIN_VALUE
    static const NaN: double = double.NAN
    static const NEGATIVE_INFINITY: double = double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
    static const POSITIVE_INFINITY: double = double.POSITIVE_INFINITY
    static const length: uint = 1

    <SIGNATURE file="Number.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">
    <SIGNATURE file="Number.es" name="override intrinsic function toLocaleString">
    <SIGNATURE file="Number.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">

    <SIGNATURE file="Number.es" name="intrinsic function toFixed">
    <SIGNATURE file="Number.es" name="intrinsic function toExponential">
    <SIGNATURE file="Number.es" name="intrinsic function toPrecision">
}
}}}

<P> The ''Number'' prototype object provides these direct properties:

{{{
    toString:       function (this: Numeric, radix) <LDOTS>
    toLocaleString: function (this: Numeric) <LDOTS>
    valueOf:        function (this: Numeric) <LDOTS>
    toFixed:        function (this: Numeric, fractionDigits) <LDOTS>
    toExponential:  function (this: Numeric, fractionDigits) <LDOTS>
    toPrecision:    function (this: Numeric, precision) <LDOTS>
}}}


== Methods on the ''Number'' class object ==

=== new Number( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC>The ''Number'' constructor initialises the newly created
''Number'' object by storing //value// (which defaults to +0),
converted to ''double'', in a private property.

<IMPL>
The ''Number'' constructor is implementation-defined.

=== Number( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> When the ''Number'' class object is called as a function it
performs a type conversion: if //value// (which defaults to +0) is not
a primitive number type it is converted to ''double''.

<RETN> The ''Number'' class object called as a function returns
//value// converted to a primitive number type.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Number.es" name="meta static function invoke">

== Value properties on the ''Number'' class object ==

=== MAX_VALUE ===

<P> The value of ''MAX_VALUE'' is the largest positive finite value
represented by the ''double'' class.

=== MIN_VALUE ===

<P> The value of ''MIN_VALUE'' is the smallest positive value
represented by the ''double'' class.

=== NaN ===

<P> The value of ''NaN'' is the not-a-number value represented by the
''double'' class.

=== NEGATIVE_INFINITY ===

<P> The value of ''NEGATIVE_INFINITY'' is the value -<INFINITY> as
represented by a ''double'' object.

=== POSITIVE_INFINITY ===

<P> The value of ''POSITIVE_INFINITY'' is the value +<INFINITY> as
represented by a ''double'' object.


== Methods on ''Number'' instances ==


=== intrinsic::toString ( radix=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts this number value to a string representation
in a base given by //radix//.

<P> If radix is the number 10 or undefined, then the result is as for the ''ToString'' operator.

<P> If radix is an integer from 2 to 36, but not 10, the result is an implementation-dependent string

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toString'' method returns a string.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Number.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

<NOTE> The intrinsic ''toString'' method operates by obtaining a
primitive number value, which it then converts to string by invoking
the intrinsic ''toString'' method on the primitive value.

=== intrinsic::toLocaleString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toLocaleString'' method converts this number
value to a string value that represents the number value formatted
according to the conventions of the host environment's current locale.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toLocaleString'' method returns an
implementation-dependent string.

<IMPL> The intrinsic ''toLocaleString'' method is
implementation-dependent, and it is permissible, but not encouraged,
for it to return the same thing as the intrinsic ''toString'' method.

<NOTE> The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that
implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.


=== intrinsic::valueOf ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns the number value
represented by this ''Number'' object.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns a primitive number value.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Number.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">


=== Intrinsic methods that delegate to methods on primitive types ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toFixed'', ''toExponential'', and
''toPrecision'' methods operate by obtaining a primitive number value
from the intrinsic ''valueOf'' method, then invoking the appropriate
method on the primitive value.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toFixed'', ''toExponential'', and
''toPrecision'' methods return what their delegates return.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Number.es" name="intrinsic function toFixed">
<INCLUDE file="Number.es" name="intrinsic function toExponential">
<INCLUDE file="Number.es" name="intrinsic function toPrecision">

== Methods on the ''Number'' prototype object ==

<DESC> The methods on the ''Number'' prototype object are constrained to
being invoked on members of the type ''Numeric''.  All operate by
calling the corresponding intrinsic method on the ''this'' object.

<NOTE> The ''Number'' prototype object is also the prototype object
for ''int'', ''uint'', ''double'', and ''decimal''.

<RETN> The methods on the ''Number'' prototype object return what
their corresponding intrinsic methods return.
