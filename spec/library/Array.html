<P> The class ''Object'' is a dynamic non-final subclass of ''Object''
(see <XREF target="class Object">).

<p> Array objects give special treatment to a certain class of
property names.  A property name that can be interpreted as an
unsigned integer less than 2<sup>32</sup>-1 is an //array index//.

<P> A property name //P// (in the form of a string value) is an array
index if and only if //string(uint(P))// is equal to //P// and
//uint(P)// is not equal to 2<sup>32</sup>-1.

<p> Every ''Array'' object has a ''length'' property whose value is
always a nonnegative integer less than 2<sup>32</sup>.  The value of
the ''length'' property is numerically greater than the name of every
property whose name is an array index; whenever a property of an Array
object is created or changed, other properties are adjusted as
necessary to maintain this invariant.  Specifically, whenever a
property is added whose name is an array index, the ''length''
property is changed, if necessary, to be one more than the numeric
value of that array index; and whenever the ''length'' property is
changed, every property whose name is an array index whose value is
not smaller than the new length is automatically deleted.  This
constraint applies only to properties of the Array object itself and
is unaffected by ''length'' or array index properties that may be
inherited from its prototype.

<P> The set of //array elements// held by any object (not just
''Array'' objects) are those properties of the object that are named
by array indices numerically less than the object's ''length''
property.  (If the object has no ''length'' property then its value is
assumed to be zero, and the object has no array elements.)

<P>The Array class provides the following interface:

== Methods on the ''Array'' class object ==

<P> The ''Array'' class provides a number of static methods for
manipulating array elements: ''concat'', ''every'', ''filter'',
''forEach'', ''indexOf'', ''join'', ''lastIndexOf'', ''map'', ''pop'',
''push'', ''reverse'', ''shift'', ''slice'', ''some'', ''sort'',
''splice'', and ''unshift''.  These static methods are intentionally
//generic//; they do not require that their //object// argument
be an ''Array'' object.  Therefore they can be applied to other kinds
of objects as well.  Whether the generic Array methods can be applied
successfully to a host object is implementation-dependent.

<COMP>The static generic methods on the Array class are all new in 4th
edition.


=== new Array ( ...items ) ===

<DESC> When the ''Array'' constructor is called with some set of
arguments //items// as part of a ''new&nbsp;Array'' expression, it
initializes the ''Array'' object from its argument values.

<P> If there is exactly one argument of any number type, then its
value is taken to be the initial value of the ''length'' property.
The value must be a nonnegative integer less than 2<sup>32</sup>.

<P> If there are zero or more than one arguments, the arguments are
taken to be the initial values of array elements, and there will be
as many elements as there are arguments.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="function Array">


=== Array ( ...items ) ===

<DESC> When ''Array'' class is called as a function rather than as a
constructor, it creates and initialises a new ''Array'' object.  Thus
the function call ''Array(<LDOTS>)'' is equivalent to the object
creation expression new ''Array(<LDOTS>)'' with the same arguments.

<RETN> The ''Array'' class called as function returns a new ''Array'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="meta static function invoke">


=== concat ( object, ...items ) ===

<DESC> The static ''concat'' method collects the array elements from
//object// followed by the array elements from the additional
//items//, in order, into a new Array object.  All the //items// must
be objects.

<RETN> The static ''concat'' method returns a new ''Array'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function concat">
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="helper static function concat">

<P>The helper ''concat'' method is also used by the intrinsic and
prototype variants of ''concat''.


=== every ( object, checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''every'' method calls //checker// on every array
element of //object// in increasing numerical index order, stopping as
soon as any call returns **false**.

<P>//Checker// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and //object// itself.  The //thisObj// is used as the
''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The static ''every'' method returns **true** if all the calls to
//checker// returned true values, otherwise it returns **false**.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function every">


=== filter ( object, checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''filter'' method calls //checker// on every array element
of //object// in increasing numerical index order, collecting all the
array elements for which checker returns a true value.

<P> //Checker// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and //object// itself.  The //thisObj// is used as the
''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The static ''filter'' method returns a new ''Array'' object
containing the elements that were collected, in the order they were
collected.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function filter">


=== forEach ( object, eacher, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''forEach'' method calls //eacher// on every array
element of //object// in increasing numerical index order, discarding
any return value of //eacher//.

<P> //Eacher// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and //object// itself.  The //thisObj// is used as the
''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The static ''forEach'' method does not return a value.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function forEach">


=== indexOf ( object, value, from=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''indexOf'' method compares //value// with every
array element of //object// in increasing numerical index order,
starting at the index //from//, stopping when an array element is
equal to //value// by the ''==='' operator.

<P> //From// is rounded toward zero before use.  If //from// is
negative, it is treated as ''//object//.length+//from//''.

<RETN> The static ''indexOf'' method returns the array index the first
time //value// is equal to an element, or -1 if no such element is
found.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function indexOf">


=== join ( object, separator=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''join'' method concatenates the string
representations of the array elements of //object// in increasing
numerical index order, separating the individual strings by
occurrences of //separator//.

<RETN> The static ''join'' method returns the complete concatenated
string.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function join">


=== lastIndexOf ( object, value, from=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''lastIndexOf'' method compares //value// with every
array element of //object// in decreasing numerical index order,
starting at the index //from//, stopping when an array element is
equal to //value// by the ''==='' operator.

<P> //From// is rounded toward zero before use.  If //from// is
negative, it is treated as ''//object//.length+//from//''.

<RETN> The static ''lastIndexOf'' method returns the array index the
first time //value// is equal to an element, or -1 if no such element
is found.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function lastIndexOf">


=== map ( object, mapper, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''map'' method calls //mapper// on each array element of
//object// in increasing numerical index order, collecting the return values
from //mapper// in a new ''Array'' object.

<P>//Mapper// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and //object// itself.  The //thisObj// is used as the
''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The static ''map'' method returns a new ''Array'' object where
the array element at index //i// is the value returned from the call
to //mapper// on //object[i]//.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function map">


=== pop ( object ) ===

<DESC> The static ''pop'' method extracts the last array element from
//object// and removes it by decreasing the value of the ''length''
property of //object// by 1.

<RETN> The static ''pop'' method returns the removed element.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function pop">


=== push ( object, ...items ) ===

<DESC> The static ''push'' method appends the values in //items// to
the end of the array elements of //object//, in the order in which
they appear, in the process updating the ''length'' property of //object//.

<RETN> The static ''push'' method returns the new value of the
''length'' property of //object//.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function push">
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="helper static function push">

<P>The helper ''push'' method is also used by the intrinsic and
prototype variants of ''push''.


=== reverse ( object ) ===

<DESC> The static ''reverse'' method rearranges the array elements of
//object// so as to reverse their order.  The ''length'' property of
//object// remains unchanged.

<RETN> The static ''reverse'' method returns //object//.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function reverse">


=== shift ( object ) ===

<DESC> The static ''shift'' method removes the element called ''0'' in
//object//, moves the element at index //i+1// to index //i//, and
decrements the ''length'' property of //object// by 1.

<RETN> The static ''shift'' method returns the element that was removed.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function shift">


=== slice ( object, start=<LDOTS>, end=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''slice'' method extracts the subrange of array
elements from //object// between //start// (inclusive) and //end//
(exclusive) into a new Array.

<P> If //start// is negative, it is treated as
''//object//.length+//start//''.  If //end// is negative, it is
treated as ''//object//.length+//end//''.  In either case the values
of //start// and //end// are bounded between 0 and
''//object//.length''.

<RETN> The static ''slice'' method returns a new ''Array'' object
containing the extracted array elements.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function slice">
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="helper function clamp">


=== some ( object, checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''some'' method calls //checker// on every array element in
//object// in increasing numerical index order, stopping as soon as //checker// returns
a true value.

<P>//Checker// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and the object itself.  The //thisObj// is used as the
''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The static ''some'' method returns **true** when //checker//
returns a true value, otherwise returns **false** if all the calls to
//checker// return false values.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function some">


=== sort (object, comparefn=<LDOTS>) ===

<DESC> The static ''sort'' method sorts the array elements of
//object//, it rearranges the elements of //object// according to some
criterion.

<P>The sort is not necessarily stable (that is, elements that compare
equal do not necessarily remain in their original order). If
//comparefn// is not **undefined**, it should be a function that
accepts two arguments //x// and //y// and returns a negative value if
//x <LT> y//, zero if //x = y//, or a positive value if //x <GT> y//.

<p>If //comparefn// is not **undefined** and is not a consistent
comparison function for the array elements of //object// (see below),
the behaviour of ''sort'' is implementation-defined.  Let //len// be
''uint(object.length)''.  If there exist integers //i// and //j//
and an object //P// such that all of the conditions below are
satisfied then the behaviour of ''sort'' is implementation-defined:

<ol>
<li> //0 <LEQ> i <LT> len//
<li> //0 <LEQ> j <LT> len//
<li> //object// does not have a property with name ''string(//i//)''
<li> //P// is obtained by following one or more [[Prototype]] properties starting at this
<li> //P// has a property with name ''string(//j//)''
</ol>

<p>Otherwise the following steps are taken.

<OL>

<LI> Let //M// be the result of calling the [[Get]] method of
//object// with argument ''"length"''.

<LI> Let //L// be the result of ''uint(//M//)''.

<LI> Perform an implementation-dependent sequence of calls to the
[[Get]], [[Put]], and [[Delete]] methods of //object// and to
//SortCompare// (described below), where the first argument for each
call to [[Get]], [[Put]], or [[Delete]] is a nonnegative integer less
than //L// and where the arguments for calls to //SortCompare// are
results of previous calls to the [[Get]] method.

</OL>

<P>Following the execution of the preceding algorithm, //object// must
have the following two properties.

<ol>
  <li> There must be some mathematical permutation <PI> of the
nonnegative integers less than //L//, such that for every nonnegative
integer //j// less than //L//, if property //old[j]// existed, then
//new[<PI>(j)]// is exactly the same value as //old[j]//, but if
property //old[j]// did not exist, then //new[<PI>(j)]// does not
exist.

  <li> Then for all nonnegative integers //j// and //k//, each
less than //L//, if //SortCompare(j,k) < 0// (see //SortCompare//
below), then //<PI>(j) < <PI>(k)//.
</ol>

<P>Here the notation //old[j]// is used to refer to the hypothetical
result of calling the [[Get]] method of this object with argument
//j// before this function is executed, and the notation //new[j]// to
refer to the hypothetical result of calling the [[Get]] method of this
object with argument //j// after this function has been executed.

<P>A function //comparefn// is a consistent comparison function for a
set of values //S// if all of the requirements below are met for all
values //a//, //b//, and //c// (possibly the same value) in the set
//S//: The notation //a &lt;CF b// means //comparefn(a,b) <LT> 0//;
//a =CF b// means //comparefn(a,b) = 0// (of either sign); and //a >CF b//
means //comparefn(a,b) > 0//.

<OL>

<LI> Calling //comparefn(a,b)// always returns the same value //v//
when given a specific pair of values //a// and //b// as its two
arguments. Furthermore, //v// has type //Number//, and //v// is not
**NaN**. Note that this implies that exactly one of //a &lt;CF b//,
//a =CF b//, and //a >CF b// will be true for a given pair of //a//
and //b//.

<LI> //a =CF a// (reflexivity)

<LI> If //a =CF b//, then //b =CF a// (symmetry)

<LI> If //a =CF b// and //b =CF c//, then //a =CF c// (transitivity of //=CF//)

<LI> If //a &lt;CF b// and //b &lt;CF c//, then //a &lt;CF c// (transitivity of //&lt;CF//)

<LI> If //a >CF b// and //b >CF c//, then //a >CF c// (transitivity of //>CF//)

</OL>

<NOTE> The above conditions are necessary and sufficient to ensure
that //comparefn// divides the set //S// into equivalence classes and
that these equivalence classes are totally ordered.

<RETN> The static ''sort'' method returns //object//.

<IMPL>
<P> The interface to the ''sort'' method can be described as follows:
<SIGNATURE file="Array.es" name="static function sort">

<P>When the //SortCompare// operator is called with two arguments
//j// and //k//, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="helper function sortCompare">

<NOTE> Because non-existent property values always compare greater
than **undefined** property values, and **undefined** always compares
greater than any other value, **undefined** property values always
sort to the end of the result, followed by non-existent property
values.


=== splice ( object, start, deleteCount, ...items ) ===

<DESC> The static ''splice'' method replaces the //deleteCount// array
elements of //object// starting at array index //start// with values
from the //items//.

<RETN> The static ''splice'' method returns a new Array object
containing the array elements that were removed from //objects//, in
order.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="static function splice">
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="helper static function splice">

<P>The helper ''clamp'' function was defined earlier (see <XREF target="Array.slice">).


=== unshift ( object, ...items ) ===

<DESC> The static ''unshift'' method inserts the values in //items//
as new array elements at the start of //object//, such that their
order within the array elements of //object// is the same as the order
in which they appear in //items//.  Existing array elements in
//object// are shifted upward in the index range, and the ''length''
property of //object// is updated.

<RETN> The static ''unshift'' method returns the new value of the
''length'' property of //object//.

== Method Properties of Array Instances ==

=== Intrinsic methods ===

<DESC> The intrinsic methods on Array instances delegate to their static

== Value properties of Array instances ==

<P>Array instances inherit properties from the Array prototype object
and also have the following properties.

=== length ===

<P>The ''length'' property of this Array object is always numerically
greater than the name of every property whose name is an array index.


== Method properties on the ''Array'' prototype object ==

=== toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The prototype ''toString'' method converts the array to a ''string''.
It has the same effect as if the intrinsic ''join'' method were invoked for this
object with no argument.

<RETN> The prototype ''toString'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="prototype function toString">

=== toLocaleString ( ) ===

<DESC>The elements of this Array are converted to strings using their
public ''toLocaleString'' methods, and these strings are then concatenated,
separated by occurrences of a separator string that has been derived
in an implementation-defined locale-specific way.  The result of
calling this function is intended to be analogous to the result of
''toString'', except that the result of this function is intended to
be locale-specific.

<RETN> The prototype ''toLocaleString'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="prototype function toLocaleString">

<NOTE>The first parameter to this method is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that
implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.

=== Generic methods ===

<P>These methods delegate to their static counterparts, and like their
counterparts, they are generic: they can be transferred to other
objects for use as methods.  Whether these methods can be applied
successfully to a host object is implementation-dependent.

<COMP>In the 3rd Edition of this Standard some of the functions on the
Array prototype object had ''length'' properties that did not reflect
those functions' signatures.  In the 4th Edition of this Standard, all
functions on the Array prototype object have ''length'' properties
that follow the general rule stated in section <XREF
target="function-semantics">.
