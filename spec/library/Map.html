OPEN ISSUES

  * 'intrinsic::clear' uses 'iterator::get' and 'intrinsic::remove' to
    perform removal.  That is by design (it allows overridden methods
    that observe or modify iteration and removal to work during
    clearing as well).  But is it desirable?


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 2 (2008-03-03)

  * The prototype 'get' and 'put' methods also accept a 'notfound'
    parameter.

  * Presentation:
    - section headers for intrinsic methods now use the syntax
      'intrinsic::foo()' instead of just 'foo'.
    - compatibility note ("new in 4th edition")
    - added an explicit "extends Object" clause.
    - the informative method 'allElements' was renamed as 'allItems'.
    - corrected a typo
    - common fields in the status block above


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 1 (2008-02-29)

  * The value returned by 'hashcode' is constrained to be a number and
    is always explicitly converted to uint

  * Map(x) returns x if x is a Map

  * 'get' and 'put' have (V|undefined) return types

  * 'get' and 'put' accept an optional value (defaulting to undefined)
    which is returned if the association was not found in the map

  * There is a new method 'clear' to clear the map

  * The object returned from helper::iterate has been annotated with
    an explicit type, fixing the next field.


NOTES

  * Informative methods:

    Informative methods on ''Map'' do not call program-visible (i.e.,
    public, protected, intrinsic, reflect, meta, iterator, or
    prototype) methods on their 'this' object except as explicitly
    specified in this document.

    (The above clarification belongs in a general preface to the
    library.)

  * Subtyping for parameterized classes: We've agreed that for a
    parameterized type Cls and type T, Cls.&lt;T&gt; is a subtype of
    Cls.&lt;*&gt;.  That has yet to be fully formalized.  The Map
    class relies on that subtyping rule for its 'this' constraints on
    prototype methods, and for type testing in the static
    'meta::invoke' method.

<P> The class ''Map'' is a parameterized, dynamic, non-final, direct
subclass of ''Object'' that provides a reliable, efficient, mutable,
and iterable map from keys to values.  Keys and values may be of
arbitrary types.

<COMP> The class ''Map'' is new in the 4th Edition of this Standard.

<P> A ''Map'' is realized as a hash table.  When the ''Map'' is
constructed the caller may provide specialized functions that compare
keys and compute hash values for keys.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Map'' provides the following interface:

{{{
__ES4__ dynamic class Map.<K,V> extends Object
{
    public function Map(equals:   function = (function(a,b) a === b),
                        hashcode: function = intrinsic::hashcode) <LDOTS>

    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="static meta function invoke">
    static public const length = 2;

    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function size">
    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function get">
    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function put">
    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function has">
    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function remove">
    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function clear">

    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="iterator function get">
    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="iterator function getKeys">
    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="iterator function getValues">
    <SIGNATURE file="Map.es" name="iterator function getItems">

    private const equals   : function = <LDOTS>
    private const hashcode : function = <LDOTS>
    private var population : uint = <LDOTS>
}
}}}

<P> The ''Map'' prototype object provides these direct properties:

{{{
    size:   function () <LDOTS>
    get:    function (key, notfound) <LDOTS>
    put:    function (key, value, notfound) <LDOTS>
    has:    function (key) <LDOTS>
    remove: function (key) <LDOTS>
    clear:  function () <LDOTS>
}}}


== Methods on the ''Map'' class object ==

=== new Map.&lt;K,V&gt;( equals=<LDOTS>, hashcode=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''Map'' constructor creates a new map for key type //K//
and value type //V//.

<P> The optional //equals// argument is a function that compares two
keys and returns **true** if they are equal and **false** if they are
not.  This function must implement a reflexive, transitive, and
symmetric relation, and //equals(k1,k2)// must be constant for any two
actual keys //k1// and //k2//.  The default value for //equals// is a
function that compares the two keys using the ''==='' operator.

<P> The optional //hashcode// argument is a function that takes a key
and returns a numeric value for it; this key is converted to a ''uint''
//hash value// for the key.  The hash value may be used to find
associations more quickly in the map.  Two calls to //hashcode// on
the same key value must always result in the same hash value, and a
call to //hashcode// must always result in the same hash value for two
key values that compare equal by the //equals// function.  The default
value for //hashcode// is the intrinsic global function ''hashcode''.

<NOTE> The constraint that //equals// and //hashcode// return
constant values does not apply to key values that are not in a ''Map''
nor referenced from an activation of any method on ''Map''.

<NOTE> There is no requirement that the values returned from
//hashcode// for two unequal keys must be different.

<NOTE> The operator ''=='' is not a valid comparator for the global
intrinsic function ''hashcode'' because ''=='' will consider some
values to be equal for which ''hashcode'' returns different hash
values.

<IMPL> The ''Map'' constructor initializes the ''Map'' object by
saving its parameters in private storage and initializing the count of
the number of associations in the table to zero.

<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="public function Map">

<FIXME> (Ticket #153) The parameters to the ''Map'' constructor should
be constrained to be ''function'', but not any more than that (because
that would be bad UI for scripts).  Currently the RI does not support
''function'' as a type annotation, so the current implementation of
the constructor is unconstrained.

=== Map( object ) ===

<DESC> When the ''Map'' class object is called as a function, it
returns a ''Map'' object.  If //object// is already a ''Map'' object
of any type then it is returned.  Otherwise, a new ''Map'' object from
''EnumerableId'' to ''*'' is created and is populated with the own
properties of //object//.

<RETN> The ''Map'' class object called as a function returns a ''Map''
object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="static meta function invoke">

<FIXME> (Tickets #247, #289, and e-mail discussion.) This method will
change if we change the meaning of statics in parameterized classes:
the map would be from ''K'' to ''V'' instead of from ''EnumerableId'' to ''*''.


== Methods on ''Map'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::size ( ) ===

<RETN> The intrinsic method ''size'' returns the number of associations in the map.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function size">

=== intrinsic::get ( key, notfound=<LDOTS> ) ===

<RETN> The intrinsic method ''get'' returns the value associated with
//key//, or //notfound// if there is no such association.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function get">

<P> The informative function ''find'' searches for //key// in the
''Map'' and returns an object containing at least the properties
''key'' and ''value'' if the association was found, or otherwise
**null**.  (The returned object is part of the ''Map'' data structure,
and writing to it updates the association in the ''Map''.)

{{{
informative function find(key: K): like { key: K, value: V } <LDOTS>
}}}

=== intrinsic::put ( key, value, notfound=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic method ''put'' creates an association between
//key// and //value//, or overwrites an existing association if there
is one.  

<RETN> The ''put'' method returns the old value of the association if
there was one, otherwise it returns //notfound//.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function put">

<P> The informative function ''insert'' adds a new association between
//key// and //value// to the ''Map''.

{{{
informative function insert(key: K, value: V): void <LDOTS>
}}}

=== intrinsic::has ( key ) ===

<RETN> The intrinsic method ''has'' returns **true** if there exists
an association for //key//, or **false** otherwise.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function has">

=== intrinsic::remove ( key ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic method ''remove'' removes any association for //key//.

<RETN> The ''remove'' method returns **true** if there was an association for //key//,
or **false** otherwise.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function remove">

<P> The informative function ''eject'' removes the association for
//key// from the ''Map''.

{{{
informative function eject(box: like { key: K, value: V }): void <LDOTS>
}}}

=== intrinsic::clear ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic method ''clear'' removes all associations from the map.

<RETN> The ''clear'' method returns nothing.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="intrinsic function clear">

== Iteration protocol on ''Map'' instances ==

<P> The iterator protocol makes use of a helper method ''iterate''
which first collects the values that will be returned by the iterator
methods and then returns an object that provides the correct ''next''
method:

<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="helper function iterate">

<P> The informative function ''allItems'' calls its function
argument on every key/value pair in the ''Map'':

{{{
informative function allItems(fn: function): void <LDOTS>
}}}

<P> The iterator methods ''getKeys'', ''getValues'', and ''getItems''
return iterator objects that iterate over keys, values, and key/value
pairs, respectively.  The iterator method ''get'' iterates over keys
(like ''getKeys'').

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="iterator function getKeys">
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="iterator function getValues">
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="iterator function getItems">
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="iterator function get">

== Methods on the ''Map'' prototype object ==

<P> The methods on the ''Map'' prototype object are constrained to
being called on instances of ''Map''.  They all delegate to the
corresponding intrinsic method on their ''this'' object.

<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="prototype function size">
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="prototype function get">
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="prototype function put">
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="prototype function has">
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="prototype function remove">
<INCLUDE file="Map.es" name="prototype function clear">
