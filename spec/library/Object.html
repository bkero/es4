= ''Object'' Objects =

<p>All values in ECMAScript except **undefined** and **null** are
instances of the class ''Object'' or one of its subclasses.

<p>The class ''Object'' has the following interface:

{{{
dynamic class Object
{
    function Object(value=undefined) ...

    meta static function invoke(value=undefined) ...

    static const length: uint = 1
    static const prototype: Object = ...

    intrinsic function toString(): string ...
    intrinsic function toLocaleString(): string ...
    intrinsic function toJSONString(...args): string ...
    intrinsic function valueOf(): Object! ...
    intrinsic function hasOwnProperty(V : EnumerableId): boolean ...
    intrinsic function isPrototypeOf(V): boolean
    intrinsic function propertyIsenumerable(prop: EnumerableId, e=undefined): boolean ...
}
}}}


== The ''Object'' Constructor Called as a Function ==

<p>When ''Object'' is called as a function rather than as a
constructor, it performs a type conversion.

=== ''Object ( value = undefined )'' ===

<p>When the ''Object'' function is called with no arguments or with one
argument value, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="meta static function invoke">


== The Object Constructor ==

<p>When ''Object'' is called as part of a new expression, it is a
constructor that may create an object.

=== ''new Object ( value = undefined )'' ===

<p>When the Object constructor is called with no arguments or with one
argument value, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="specialObjectConstructor">


== Properties of the ''Object'' Constructor ==

<p> The value of the internal [[Prototype]] property of the Object
constructor is the Function prototype object.

<p>Besides the internal properties and the ''length'' property (whose
value is 1), the Object constructor has the following properties:

=== ''Object.prototype'' ===

<p>The initial value of Object.prototype is the Object prototype object (<XREF target="obj-proto-props">).

<p>This property has the attributes { DontEnum, DontDelete, ReadOnly }.


== Methods on Object instances ==

=== ''toString ( )'' ===

<p>When the ''toString'' method is called, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="intrinsic function toString">


=== ''toLocaleString ( )'' ===

<p>This function returns the result of calling ''toString()''.

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="intrinsic function toLocaleString">

<p class="note">NOTE 1<br>
This function is provided to give all Objects a generic ''toLocaleString'' interface, even though not
all may use it. Currently, Array, Number, and Date provide their own locale-sensitive
toLocaleString methods.

<p class="note">NOTE 2<br>
The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a future version of this standard; it is
recommended that implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.


=== ''toJSONString ( )'' ===

<p>This function returns the result of calling ''toJSONString()''.

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="intrinsic function toJSONString">


=== ''valueOf ( )'' ===

<p>The ''valueOf'' method returns its this value. If the object is the
result of calling the Object constructor with a host object (<XREF
target="host-object-defn">), it is implementation-defined whether
''valueOf'' returns its this value or another value such as the host
object originally passed to the constructor.


=== ''hasOwnProperty (V)'' ===

<p>When the ''hasOwnProperty'' method is called with argument ''V'', the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="intrinsic function hasOwnProperty">

<p class="note">NOTE<br>
Unlike [[HasProperty]] (<XREF target="HasProperty-defn">), this method does not consider objects in the prototype chain.


=== ''isPrototypeOf (V)'' ===

<p>When the ''isPrototypeOf'' method is called with argument ''V'', the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="intrinsic function isPrototypeOf">


=== ''propertyIsEnumerable (V)'' ===

<p>When the ''propertyIsEnumerable'' method is called with argument
''V'', the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="intrinsic function propertyIsEnumerable">

<p class="note">NOTE<br>
This method does not consider objects in the prototype chain.


<h2 id="obj-proto-props">Properties of the Object Prototype Object</h2>

<p>The value of the internal [[Prototype]] property of the Object prototype object is null and the value of
the internal [[Class]] property is "Object".


=== Methods on the Object prototype object ===

<p>The methods on the object prototype object all call the
corresponding intrinsic methods of the Object class, as follows.

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function toString">
<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function toLocaleString">
<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function toJSONString">
<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function valueOf">
<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function hasOwnProperty">
<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function isPrototypeOf">
<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function propertyIsEnumerable">


=== ''Object.prototype.constructor'' ===

<p>The initial value of ''Object.prototype.constructor'' is the built-in ''Object'' constructor.


== Properties of Object Instances ==

<p>Object instances have no special properties beyond those inherited from the Object prototype object.
