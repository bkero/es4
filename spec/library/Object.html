<!-- The "Object" object

     Based on older content.

     This is just an experiment; I'm playing around.

     Shorthands that reduce visual and contextual clutter:

        ''..''    means "<code>..</code>"
        [[..]]    means "<code>[[..]]</code>"

        <h1>      means "<hn>" where n is computed from the context
        <h2>      means "<hn>" where n is computed from the context
        and so on

        = ... =   means "<h1> ... </h1>"
        == ... == means "<h2> ... </h2>"
        and so on

     Magic tags that the preprocessor removes:

        <INCLUDE file="..." name="..."> is replaced by the function,
                         inside a PRE tag.

        <XREF target="..."> resolves to the section number of "tag", where "tag" is some ID
                         on a header element somewhere (could be in a different file)

     These tags must be upper case, note no "/>" termination

= ''Object'' Objects =

== The ''Object'' Constructor Called as a Function ==

<p>When ''Object'' is called as a function rather than as a
constructor, it performs a type conversion.

=== ''Object ( [ value ] )'' ===

<p>When the ''Object'' function is called with no arguments or with one
argument value, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="meta static function invoke">

=== The Object Constructor ===

<p>When ''Object'' is called as part of a new expression, it is a
constructor that may create an object.

=== ''new Object ( [ value ] )'' ===

<p>When the Object constructor is called with no arguments or with one
argument value, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="eval.sml" name="specialObjectConstructor">


== Properties of the ''Object'' Constructor ==

<p> The value of the internal [[Prototype]] property of the Object
constructor is the Function prototype object.

<p>Besides the internal properties and the ''length'' property (whose
value is 1), the Object constructor has the following properties:

=== ''Object.prototype'' ===

<p>The initial value of Object.prototype is the Object prototype object (<XREF target="obj-proto-props">).

<p>This property has the attributes { DontEnum, DontDelete, ReadOnly }.


<h2 id="obj-proto-props">Properties of the Object Prototype Object</h2>

<p>The value of the internal [[Prototype]] property of the Object prototype object is null and the value of
the internal [[Class]] property is "Object".


=== ''Object.prototype.constructor'' ===

<p>The initial value of ''Object.prototype.constructor'' is the built-in ''Object'' constructor.


=== ''Object.prototype.toString ( )'' ===

<p>When the ''toString'' method is called, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="private static function toString">


=== ''Object.prototype.toLocaleString ( )'' ===

<p>This function returns the result of calling ''toString()''.

<p class="note">NOTE 1<br>
This function is provided to give all Objects a generic toLocaleString interface, even though not
all may use it. Currently, Array, Number, and Date provide their own locale-sensitive
toLocaleString methods.

<p class="note">NOTE 2<br>
The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a future version of this standard; it is
recommended that implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.


=== ''Object.prototype.valueOf ( )'' ===

<p>The valueOf method returns its this value. If the object is the result of calling the Object
constructor with a host object (<XREF target="host-object-defn">), it is implementation-defined whether valueOf returns its
this value or another value such as the host object originally passed to the constructor.


=== ''Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty (V)'' ===

<p>When the hasOwnProperty method is called with argument V, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function hasOwnProperty">

<p class="note">NOTE<br>
Unlike [[HasProperty]] (<XREF target="HasProperty-defn">), this method does not consider objects in the prototype chain.


=== ''Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf (V)'' ===

<p>When the isPrototypeOf method is called with argument V, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function isPrototypeOf">


=== ''Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable (V)'' ===

<p>When the propertyIsEnumerable method is called with argument V, the following steps are
taken:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="prototype function propertyIsEnumerable">

<p class="note">NOTE<br>
This method does not consider objects in the prototype chain.


== Properties of Object Instances ==

<p>Object instances have no special properties beyond those inherited from the Object prototype object.
