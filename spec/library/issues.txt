// Interesting open questions (bugs to be filed in the Trac)

* There's some functionality that has to be present that's currently
  only available in regexes, as character classification; this could
  be exposed as some function "classify" on a Unicode class or
  package.  But it could also be added to "String", say.

* JSON functions might be available as static functions, by analogy
  with what we do with static functions in Array and String.

* In fact, should there not be one common "Library" or
  "LibraryInternals" package that private stuff can go into?

* It would be incredibly useful for Array.prototype.some to return the
  value that matches... even if it means that "false" can't be found
  and that clients have to be careful around zero, null, and
  undefined.

  Alternatively, impement an interface Array.prototype.find() that
  returns an index if it finds the element or -1 if not.

* Is the interface to the static Array methods typed or untyped?  The
  interface to the prototype methods must be untyped for backwards
  compatibility, and the interface to the intrinsic methods must be
  typed because that's the "right thing"; the statics occupy a middle
  ground -- they are in FF (and are untyped there) but are not
  implemented elsewhere, yet in some sense it's "right" for them to be
  typed.
