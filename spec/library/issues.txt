// Interesting open questions (bugs to be filed in the Trac)

* What does ToInteger do if its argument is decimal?  Currently we
  assume it returns double... but for decimals, one would hope it
  would return a decimal.  And ToInteger is really generic, if we add
  bignums or complexes or rationals it may need to adapt.

* There's some functionality that has to be present that's currently
  only available in regexes, as character classification; this could
  be exposed as some function "classify" on a Unicode class or
  package.  But it could also be added to "String", say.

* JSON functions might be available as static functions, by analogy
  with what we do with static functions in Array and String.

* In fact, should there not be one common "Library" or
  "LibraryInternals" package that private stuff can go into?

* It would be incredibly useful for Array.prototype.some to return the
  value that matches... even if it means that "false" can't be found
  and that clients have to be careful around zero, null, and
  undefined.

  Alternatively, impement an interface Array.prototype.find() that
  returns an index if it finds the element or -1 if not.
