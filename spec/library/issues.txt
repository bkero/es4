// Interesting open questions (bugs to be filed in the Trac)

* What does ToInteger do if its argument is decimal?  Currently we
  assume it returns double... but for decimals, one would hope it
  would return a decimal.  And ToInteger is really generic, if we add
  bignums or complexes or rationals it may need to adapt.

* There's some functionality that has to be present that's currently
  only available in regexes, as character classification; this could
  be exposed as some function "classify" on a Unicode class or
  package.  But it could also be added to "String", say.

* JSON functions might be available as static functions, by analogy
  with what we do with static functions in Array and String.

* In fact, should there not be one common "Library" or
  "LibraryInternals" package that private stuff can go into?
