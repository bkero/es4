<P> The intrinsic meta-object interfaces ''Type'', ''NominalType'',
''ClassType'', ''InterfaceType'', ''AnyType'', ''UndefinedType'',
''NullType'', ''UnionType'', ''RecordType'', ''ArrayType'',
''FunctionType'', ''Field'', and ''FieldValue'', along with the
intrinsic helper types ''FieldIterator'', ''NominalTypeIterator'',
''TypeIterator'', ''ValueIterator'', and ''FieldValueIterator'',
provide a simple reflection capability.

<P> The standard meta-objects described by the interface types may be
immutable.

<FIXME> (Ticket #199.) Right now the class ''Class'' is not defined in
ES4.  (Nor is there an ''Interface'', nor are there described classes
for other type objects.)  If these are defined, then we must decide
whether they implement the meta-object interfaces or not.  Otherwise
we have problems of nonportability due to name shadowing in some
systems but not in others, or subclassability in some systems but not
in others.

<P> ECMAScript implementations may choose to provide extensions to
these interfaces, in order to provide richer reflective capabilities.
Clients wishing to use extended meta-object interfaces can perform
runtime downcasts on the meta-objects described by this Standard.

<FIXME> (Ticket #200.)  The meta-objects system does not currently deal with
parameterized types.  It will almost certainly need to.  First,
classes can contain type definitions and those definitions can be
public, and it would be strange if they could not be iterated by the
''publicMembers'' and ''publicStaticMembes'' methods of
''NominalType''.  But type definitions can bind type parameters, so
there would need to be a representation of that.  Second, method
definitions can bind type parameters (this facility is used in eg the
''Map'' class for internal helper methods), so even if type
definitions were not iterated we'd have to deal with the problem for
methods.

<P class="fixme"> There is also the question of what the meaning of
''typeOf(Map)'' means, when ''Map'' is a paremeterized type.
Presumably that too needs to reveal parameterization in some way.

<P class="fixme"> The original meta-objects proposal had some
facilities for parameterization in the context of instantiation: the
''construct'' methods would take a type iterator that would provide
values for type parameters.  But that's not good enough, and the
following spec does not provide for these.  Something like that will
come back in, though.

<P class="fixme"> There will probably be a new interface
''ParemeterizedType'' that acts as a binder for type parameters:

<PRE class="fixme">
interface ParameterizedType
{
    function numberOfParameters()
    function construct(typeVals: TypeIterator): Type
}
</PRE>

<P class="fixme"> We must decide whether only instantiated types can
be manipulated or not.  If so, then we could then arrange for a "dummy
type" factory to allow easy instantiation for inspection purposes:

<PRE class="fixme">
intrinsic function dummyTypes(t: Type): TypeIterator
</PRE>

<P class="fixme"> That may or may not run afoul of type checking, if
any type checking happens at instantiation time.  The alternative
would be to provide an interface for ''TypeParameter'', and for
''ParameterizedType'' to allow inspection of its contained type
without instantiation, with the proviso that ''TypeParameter'' values
will pop up during inspection and will have to be handled.

<NOTE> In the following sections all interfaces, types, and methods
are implicitly defined in the ''intrinsic'' namespace.  The methods
defined on the interfaces are not defined on the prototypes of the
classes that implement those interfaces.

<NOTE> Type annotations that denote nullable types are revealed as a
union of ''NullType'' and another type.

== Retrieving the type of an object ==

=== typeOf ( v ) ===

<DESC> The global intrinsic function ''typeOf'' delivers the run-time
type of its argument //v//, which may be a value of any type.

<RETN> The function ''typeOf'' returns an object that implements
''Type'' and possibly one of the interfaces extending ''Type''.

<IMPL> The function ''typeOf'' is implementation-dependent.


== The interface ''Type'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''Type'' describes a type in the system in
basic terms.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface Type 
{
    function canConvertTo(t: Type): boolean
    function isSubtypeOf(t: Type): boolean
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== canConvertTo ( t ) ====

<RETN> The ''canConvertTo'' method returns **true** if this type can
be converted to the type //t//, otherwise it returns **false**.

==== isSubtypeOf ( t ) ====

<RETN> The ''isSubtypeOf'' method returns **true** if this type is a
subtype of the type //t//, otherwise it returns **false**.


== The interface ''Field'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''Field'' describes a field (property) of
a class, record, or array type by the field name and field type.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface Field
{
    function name(): Name
    function type(): Type
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== name ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''name'' method returns the field name as a ''Name'' object.

==== type ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''type'' method returns the field type as an object that
implements ''Type'' or one of the interfaces extending ''Type''.


== The interface ''FieldValue'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''FieldValue'' describes a field
(property) of a record or array by the field name and field value.  It
is used for constructing new record and array instances.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface FieldValue
{
    function name(): Name
    function value(): *
}
}}}


=== Methods ===

==== name ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''name'' method returns the field name as a ''Name''
object.

==== value ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''value'' method returns the actual field value as an
ECMAScript value.


== The interface ''NominalType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''NominalType'' is a base interface for
''InterfaceType'' and ''ClassType''.  It provides accessors for
aspects common to those two types.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface NominalType extends Type
{
    function name(): Name
    function superTypes(): NominalTypeIterator
    function publicMembers(): FieldIterator
    function publicStaticMembers(): FieldIterator
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== name ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''name'' method returns the name of the nominal type as a
''Name'' object.

==== superTypes ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''superTypes'' method returns an iterator that iterates
over the superclasses and implemented interfaces of this nominal type.

==== publicMembers ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''publicMembers'' method returns an iterator that iterates
over the field definitions of all public instance fields (both method
properties and value properties).

==== publicStaticMembers ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''publicMembers'' method returns an iterator that iterates
over the field definitions of all public class fields (both method
properties and value properties).

<P> The constructor method is included in the set of static members,
provided that it is public.

<FIXME> (Ticket #200.) Likely, this will also iterate type definitions (see comment
at the start of this chapter).


== The interface ''InterfaceType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''InterfaceType'' describes an interface.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface InterfaceType extends NominalType
{
    function implementedBy(): ClassTypeIterator
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== implementedBy ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''implementedBy'' method returns an interator that iterates
over all the class types that implement this interface.


== The interface ''ClassType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''ClassType'' describes a class and
provides a means of creating new instances of the class.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface ClassType extends NominalType
{
    function construct(valArgs: ValueIterator): Object
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== construct ( valArgs ) ====

<DESC> The ''construct'' method creates a new instance of the class
represented by this ''ClassType'', provided the class's constructor is
public.

<P> The iterator //valArgs// provides any value arguments required by
the constructor.  Only as many values as necessary for calling the
constructor will be consumed from the iterator.  If the constructor
takes no arguments then //valArgs// may be null.

<RETN> The ''construct'' method returns a new object of the type
represented by this ''ClassType''.

== The interface ''AnyType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''AnyType'' describes the type ''*''.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface AnyType extends Type
{
}
}}}

== The interface ''NullType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''NullType'' describes the type ''null''.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface NullType extends Type
{
}
}}}


== The interface ''UndefinedType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''UndefinedType'' describes the type ''undefined''.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface UndefinedType extends Type
{
}
}}}

== The interface ''UnionType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''UnionType'' describes a union of other
types.  No object has a union type for its manifest type.  Union types
are only used for annotating parameters or fields, and cannot be instantiated.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface UnionType extends Type
{
    function members(): TypeIterator
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== members ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''members'' method returns an iterator that iterates over the
member types of the union.


== The interface ''RecordType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''RecordType'' describes a structural
object type.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface RecordType extends Type
{
    function fields(): FieldIterator
    function construct(valArgs: FieldValueIterator): Object
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== fields ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''fields'' method returns an iterator that iterates over
the fields of the record type.

==== construct ( valArgs ) ====

<DESC> The ''construct'' method creates a new instance of the
structural object type represented by this ''RecordType''.

<P> The iterator //valArgs// provides any field names and values
required to initialize the object.  All values will be consumed from
the iterator; the iterator may provide more field names and values
than are required by the type.  If the iterator does not provide a
value for a field required by the type, the field will be initialized
to **undefined** cast to the type of the field; this may cause a
**TypeError** exception to be thrown at run-time.

<P> //ValArgs// may not be null.

<RETN> The ''construct'' method returns a new object of the type
represented by this ''RecordType''.

== The interface ''ArrayType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''ArrayType'' describes a structural array
type.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface ArrayType extends Type
{
    function fields(): FieldIterator
    function construct(length: uint, valArgs: FieldValueIterator): Object
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== fields ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''fields'' method returns an iterator that iterates over
the fields of the array type.  The fields are iterated from low to
high indices, and only fields that are present are iterated.  The name
of the field provides the field index as the ''identifier''.

==== construct ( length, valArgs ) ====

<DESC> The ''construct'' method creates a new instance of the
structural array type represented by this ''ArrayType''.

<P> The value //length// provides the value for the length of the
array; it is set after all fields have been initialized.

<P> The iterator //valArgs// provides any field names and values
required to initialize the object.  All values will be consumed from
the iterator; the iterator may provide more field names and values
than are required by the type.  The field name must encode the correct
array index of the field in the ''identifier''.  If the iterator does
not provide a value for a field required by the type, the field will
be initialized to **undefined** cast to the type of the field; this
may cause a **TypeError** exception to be thrown at run-time.

<P> //ValArgs// may not be null.

<RETN> The ''construct'' method returns a new object of the type
represented by this ''ArrayType''.

== The interface ''FunctionType'' ==

<P> The intrinsic interface ''FunctionType'' describes a structural
function type.  Function types cannot be instantiated.

=== Synopsis ===

{{{
interface FunctionType extends Type
{
    function boundThis(): Type
    function argTypes(): TypeIterator
    function defaultValues(): ValueIterator
    function hasRestType(): boolean
    function returnType(): Type
}
}}}

=== Methods ===

==== boundThis ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''boundThis'' method returns a type if the function has a
bound ''this'' value, otherwise it returns an ''AnyType'' object.

==== argTypes ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''argTypes'' method returns an iterator that iterates over
the types of the formal parameters of the function, starting with the
first argument and iterating in order, including all optional and rest
arguments.

<P> Arguments that do not have annotations will be revealed as type
''AnyType''.

==== defaultValues ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''defaultValues'' method returns an iterator that iterates
over the default values of the optional arguments, starting with the
first default value and iterating in order.

==== hasRestTypes() ====

<RETN> The ''hasRestTypes'' method returns **true** if the function
has a rest argument, **false** otherwise.

==== returnType ( ) ====

<RETN> The ''returnType'' method returns the return type annotation
for this function, or an ''AnyType'' object if there was no type
annotation.


== Iterator types ==

<P> The following iterator type definitions are used as annotations on
parameters and methods in the interface hierarchy described
previously.

{{{
type FieldIterator = iterator::IteratorType.<Field>
type ClassTypeIterator = iterator::IteratorType.<ClassType>
type NominalTypeIterator = iterator::IteratorType.<NominalType>
type TypeIterator = iterator::IteratorType.<Type>
type FieldValueIterator = iterator::IteratorType.<FieldValue>
type ValueIterator = iterator::IteratorType.<*>
}}}
