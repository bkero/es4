<P> The class ''byte'' is a final, non-nullable, non-dynamic direct
subclass of ''Object'' that represents two's complement unsigned 8-bit
integer values in the range 0 to 255 inclusive.

<P> The class ''byte'' is unusual in that it cannot be instantiated;
byte values are always represented as ''uint'' in computations.
Instead, ''byte'' is intended to be used as an annotation on variables
and as the element type of ''Vector''.  Used as an annotation it
causes the truncation of other number values to the ''byte'' range,
and used as the element type in ''Vector'' some implementations will
store byte data efficiently.

<COMP> The class ''byte'' is new in the 4th Edition of this Standard.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''byte'' provides the following interface:

{{{
final class byte!
{
    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="meta static function invoke">
    
    static const MAX_VALUE: byte = 255
    static const MIN_VALUE: byte = 0
    static const length: uint = 1
}
}}}

<P> The ''byte'' class has no instance methods or variables, since no
instances are ever created.

<P> The ''byte'' prototype object is identical to the ''Number''
prototype object (<XREF target="Number.prototype">).

== Methods on the ''byte'' class object ==

=== int( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> When the ''byte'' class object is called as a function it
performs a type conversion: it converts //value// (which defaults
to 0) to an unsigned integer.

<RETN> The ''byte'' class object called as a function returns a
''uint''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="byte.es" name="meta static function invoke">

== Value properties on the ''int'' class object ==

=== MAX_VALUE ===

<P> The value of ''MAX_VALUE'' is the largest positive integer value
represented by the ''byte'' class.  Its value is 2<SUP>8</SUP>-1.

=== MIN_VALUE ===

<P> The value of ''MIN_VALUE'' is the smallest value
represented by the ''int'' class.  Its value is 0.
