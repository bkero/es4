CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 1 (2008-03-05)

  * Presentation: added an explicit "extends Object" clause


OPEN ISSUES

  * Namespace objects in ES4 are more opaque than the Namespace
    objects in the base document and in E4X, both of which expose
    "prefix" and "name" properties.  ES4 is not supporting E4X, and
    the base document was probably influenced by E4X, so this
    may not be a big deal, but it should be discussed.

<HR>

<P> The class ''Namespace'' is a final, non-dynamic, direct subclass
of ''Object''.  It reflects a namespace as an opaque datum.

<NOTE> Namespaces are created as a result of the evaluation of the
''namespace'' pragma, which defines a new namespace and creates a
binding for it.  Namespaces are reflected as ''Namespace'' objects
when namespace bindings are referenced in expressions.

<COMP> The ''Namespace'' class is new in the 4th Edition of this Standard.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Namespace'' provides the following interface:

{{{
__ES4__ final class Namespace extends Object
{
    intrinsic function toString(): string <LDOTS>
}
}}}

<P> The ''Namespace'' prototype object provides the following direct
properties:

{{{
    toString: function () <LDOTS>
}}}

== Methods on the ''Namespace'' class object ==

<P> There are no methods on the ''Namespace'' class object.  In
particular, the class ''Namespace'' does not have a publicly
accessible constructor.


== Methods on ''Namespace'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString() ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts the ''Namespace''
object to a string.  If the ''Namespace'' object was created with an
explicit name then the string contains that name as a substring.

<NOTE>A ''Namespace'' object can be created with an explicit name by
providing the name as a string in the ''namespace'' pragma.

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns an implementation-defined string.

<IMPL> The ''toString'' method is implementation-defined.
    

== Methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object ==

<DESC> The methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object delegate to
their corresponding intrinsic methods.

<RETN> The methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object return what
their corresponding intrinsic methods return.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
prototype function toString(this:Namespace)
    this.intrinsic::toString()
}}}
