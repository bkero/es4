CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 3 (2008-06-23)

  * 'name' is now a const property, not a getter method.


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 2 (2008-03-17)

  * There is a public constructor for Namespace objects 

  * The 'Namespace' class object can be invoked as a function

  * There is a getter for a 'name' property on Namespace objects

  * The 'toString' method is tagged "override"

  * Presentation: More elaborate status block above


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 1 (2008-03-05)

  * Presentation: added an explicit "extends Object" clause

  * Namespaces are explicitly designated nullable and a null value is
    tied to the compatibility namespace noNS

  * The behavior of the 'toString' method has been tightly specified
    to allow Namespace objects to be compared predictably


NOTES

  * "Forgeable" and "unforgeable" namespaces are discussed in the
    language spec.  A forgeable namespace is created from a string, as
    with 'namespace f = "my namespace"'.  An unforgeable namespace is
    created not from a string, as with 'namespace u'

  * The constructor and the 'name' getter are compatible with E4X

<P> The class ''Namespace'' is a final, non-dynamic, nullable,
direct subclass of ''Object''.

<NOTE> ''Namespace'' values can be created by ''new'' expressions in
the user program or by the evaluation of a ''namespace'' definition,
which creates a new namespace and a constant binding for it.

<COMP> The ''Namespace'' class is new in the 4th Edition of this
Standard.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Namespace'' provides the following interface:

{{{
__ES4__ final class Namespace extends Object
{
    public function Namespace(name=undefined) <LDOTS>
    static meta function invoke(x) <LDOTS>

    static public const length = 1

    override intrinsic function toString(): string <LDOTS>

    const name: (string|undefined) <LDOTS>
}
}}}

<P> The ''Namespace'' prototype object provides the following direct
properties:

{{{
    toString: function () <LDOTS>
}}}


== Operators ==

<P> The operators ''=='' and ''==='' compare forgeable ''Namespace''
objects by comparing their names as obtained by the ''name'' accessor,
see below.  Forgeable namespaces with the same name are equal by those
operators.

<P> In all other cases, ''Namespace'' objects are equal only to
themselves.


== Methods on the ''Namespace'' class object ==

=== new Namespace(name=<LDOTS>) ===

<RETN> When the ''Namespace'' constructor is called with no arguments
or with the argument **undefined** it returns a new unforgeable
''Namespace'' object.  The returned object is unequal to every
previously existing ''Namespace'' object.

<P> When the ''Namespace'' constructor is called with an argument
//name// that is not **undefined** it converts //name// to string and
returns a new forgeable namespace whose name is the converted value.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
public function Namespace(name=undefined) <LDOTS>
}}}

=== Namespace(x) ===

<RETN> The ''Namespace'' class object called as a function returns a
''Namespace'' object.  If //x// is a ''Namespace'' object then it is
returned.  Otherwise a new ''Namespace'' object is constructed by 
invoking the ''Namespace'' constructor on //x//.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
static meta function invoke( x ): Namespace! {
    if (x is Namespace!)
        return x;
    return new Namespace(x);
}
}}}

== Methods on ''Namespace'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString() ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts the ''Namespace''
object to a string.  If the ''Namespace'' object is forgeable (it was
created with an explicit name) then the string returned by
''toString'' contains the name as a substring.

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns an implementation-defined
string.  

<P> Suppose the intrinsic ''toString'' method is invoked on two
namespaces //N1// and //N2// yielding strings //T1// and //T2//,
respectively.  //T1// and //T2// are equal if and only if //N1// is
equal to //N2// (by ''==='' or ''=='').

<P> Suppose the intrinsic ''toString'' method is invoked on two
different forgeable namespaces //N1// and //N2// created from strings
//S1// and //S2//, yielding strings //T1// and //T2//, respectively.
//T1// and //T2// have the same relationship (determined by the
relational operators) as //S1// and //S2//.


== Value Properties on ''Namespace'' instances ==

=== name ===

<DESC> If this ''Namespace'' object is a forgeable namespace then the
value of the property ''name'' is the string name with which the
namespace was constructed.

<P> If this ''Namespace'' object is an unforgeable namespace then the
value of the property ''name'' is **undefined**.


== Methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object ==

<DESC> The methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object delegate to
their corresponding intrinsic methods.

<RETN> The methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object return what
their corresponding intrinsic methods return.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
prototype function toString(this:Namespace)
    this.intrinsic::toString()
}}}
