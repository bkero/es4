CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 2 (2008-03-17)

  * The 'toString' method is tagged "override"

CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 1 (2008-03-05)

  * Presentation: added an explicit "extends Object" clause

  * Namespaces are explicitly designated nullable and a null value is
    tied to the compatibility namespace noNS.

  * The behavior of the 'toString' method has been tightly specified
    to allow Namespace objects to be compared predictably.


OPEN ISSUES

  * Namespace objects in ES4 are more opaque than the Namespace
    objects in the base document and in E4X, both of which expose
    "prefix" and "name" properties.  ES4 is not supporting E4X, and
    the base document was probably influenced by E4X, so this
    may not be a big deal, but it should be discussed.

<HR>

<P> The class ''Namespace'' is a final, non-dynamic, nullable,
direct subclass of ''Object''.  It reflects a namespace as an opaque
datum.

<NOTE> Namespaces are created as a result of the evaluation of the
''namespace'' pragma, which defines a new namespace and creates a
binding for it.  Namespaces are reflected as ''Namespace'' objects
when namespace bindings are referenced in expressions.

<NOTE> A ''Namespace'' object can be created with an explicit name by
providing the name as a string in the ''namespace'' pragma.

<NOTE> Generally a **null** namespace value is used to denote the
compatibility namespace **noNS**.

<COMP> The ''Namespace'' class is new in the 4th Edition of this
Standard.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Namespace'' provides the following interface:

{{{
__ES4__ final class Namespace extends Object
{
    override intrinsic function toString(): string <LDOTS>
}
}}}

<P> The ''Namespace'' prototype object provides the following direct
properties:

{{{
    toString: function () <LDOTS>
}}}

== Operators ==

<P> The operators ''=='' and ''==='' compare as equal two non-opaque
''Namespace'' objects that are separately created from the same string;
similarly, the operators ''!='' and ''!=='' compare as not equal two
''Namespace'' objects that are separately created from dissimilar strings.


== Methods on the ''Namespace'' class object ==

<P> There are no methods on the ''Namespace'' class object.  In
particular, the class ''Namespace'' does not have a publicly
accessible constructor.


== Methods on ''Namespace'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString() ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts the ''Namespace''
object to a string.  If the ''Namespace'' object was created with an
explicit name then the string contains that name as a substring.

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns an implementation-defined
string.  

<P> Suppose the intrinsic ''toString'' method is invoked on two
namespaces //N1// and //N2// yielding strings //T1// and //T2//,
respectively.  //T1// and //T2// are equal if and only if //N1// is
equal to //N2// (by ''==='' or ''=='').

<P> Suppose the intrinsic ''toString'' method is invoked on two
different non-opaque namespaces //N1// and //N2// created from strings
//S1// and //S2//, yielding strings //T1// and //T2//, respectively.
//T1// and //T2// have the same relationship (determined by the
relational operators) as //S1// and //S2//.

== Methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object ==

<DESC> The methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object delegate to
their corresponding intrinsic methods.

<RETN> The methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object return what
their corresponding intrinsic methods return.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
prototype function toString(this:Namespace)
    this.intrinsic::toString()
}}}
