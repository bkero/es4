<P> The class ''Namespace'' is a final, nullable, non-dynamic, direct
subclass of ''Object''.  It represents objects that are created by the
evaluation of the ''namespace'' pragma.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Namespace'' provides the following interface:

{{{
final class Namespace
{
    function toString();
}
}}}

<P> The ''Namespace'' prototype object does not provide any new direct
properties.

== Methods on the ''Namespace'' class object ==

<P> There are no methods on the ''Namespace'' class object.  In
particular, the class ''Namespace'' does not have a publicly
accessible constructor.

== Methods on ''Namespace'' instances ==

=== toString() ===

<DESC> The ''toString'' method converts the ''Namespace'' object to a
string.  If the ''Namespace'' object was created with an explicit name
then the string contains that name.

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns an implementation-defined string.

<IMPL> The ''toString'' method is implementation-defined.
