<P> The class ''Namespace'' is a final, nullable, non-dynamic, direct
subclass of ''Object''.  It represents objects that are created by the
evaluation of the ''namespace'' pragma.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Namespace'' provides the following interface:

{{{
final class Namespace
{
    intrinsic function toString();
}
}}}

<P> The ''Namespace'' prototype object provides the following direct
properties:

{{{
    toString: function () <LDOTS>
}}}

== Methods on the ''Namespace'' class object ==

<P> There are no methods on the ''Namespace'' class object.  In
particular, the class ''Namespace'' does not have a publicly
accessible constructor.

== Methods on ''Namespace'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString() ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts the ''Namespace''
object to a string.  If the ''Namespace'' object was created with an
explicit name then the string contains that name as a string.

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns an implementation-defined string.

<IMPL> The ''toString'' method is implementation-defined.


== Methods on the ''Namespace'' prototype object ==

=== toString() ==

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns what the intrinsic ''toString''
method returns.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
prototype function toString(this:Namespace)
    this.intrinsic::toString()
}}}
