<P> The class ''Vector'' is a parameterized, final, dynamic direct
subclass of ''Object''.  It represents dense, typed, 0-based,
one-dimensional arrays with bounds checking and optionally fixed
length.

<FIXME> It may not be necessary for ''Vector'' to be final, as long as
the catchall getters and setters and the getters and setters for
''length'' are final.

<P> The class ''Vector'' provides two benefits.  One is optimization:
the restrictions placed on the class--denseness and a predefined
iteration order--makes it possible for ECMAScript implementations to
implement it particularly efficiently.  The other is error checking:
''Vector'' provides stronger type checking and bounds checking than
''Array''.

<COMP> The class ''Vector'' is new in the 4th Edition of this Standard.

<P> The class ''Vector'' provides a method suite that is largely
compatible with the class ''Array''.

<NOTE> It is likely that many current uses of ''Array'' can switch to
use ''Vector'' without much work, and receive the benefits of stronger
type and bounds checking.

<P> The type parameter of the ''Vector'' is called its //base type//.

<P> Since the ''Vector'' class is dynamic new properties can be added
to its instances, but any property whose name is a number (an instance
of any class in the type ''Numbers'') is handled specially.  These
properties are called //indexed properties//.

<P> Only indexed properties named by nonnegative integers less than
the value of the property ''length'' are defined, and only indexed
properties named by nonnegative integers less than 2<SUP>32</SUP>-1
can be defined.

<P> Any attempt to read an undefined indexed property results in a
**RangeError** exception being thrown.

<P> Any attempt to write an undefined indexed property results in a
**RangeError** being thrown unless the index is equal to the current
value of ''length'', the current value of ''length'' is not
2<SUP>32</SUP>-1, and the value of the ''fixed'' property is not
**true**.

<P> The ''fixed'' property is a flag that determines whether the
vector has a fixed length or not.  Any attempt to update the value of
''length'' fails if the ''fixed'' property has the value **true**.

<NOTE> If ''v'' is a ''Vector'' then reading and writing ''v[3.14]''
or ''v[-3]'' will always fail, though reading and writing
''v["3.14"]'' or ''v["-3"]'' will succeed.  

<P> A vector does not have "holes" in its index range: all indexed
properties named by nonnegative integers less than ''length'' are
always defined.

<P class="note"> This deviates from the 3rd Edition, where strings and
numbers are interchangeable as property names.  But that's no longer
quite true in 4th Edition anyway (we have name spaces and Name
objects).

<P class="note">Most attempts to set or get properties that are named
by numbers that are not valid array indices are probably errors,
especially if the object is an Array.  Most attempts to read beyond
the end of an Array are probably errors.  And in a number of cases,
attempts to write beyond the end of an Array are probably errors too.
The ''Vector'' class makes it possible to discover these errors.

<FIXME> Iterators!!

<P> The ''Vector'' prototype object does not provide any direct properties.

== Methods on the ''Vector'' class object ==

=== new Vector.<T> ( length=<LDOTS>, fixed=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''Vector'' constructor initializes a new ''Vector'' object.

<P> //Length// is the inital value of the ''length'' property.  Every
indexed element of the new vector below //length// is initialized to
**undefined** cast to the base type //T//.

<P> //Fixed// is the initial value of the ''fixed'' property.

<IMPL> The ''Vector'' constructor is implementation-defined.


=== Vector.<T>( object ) ===

<DESC> When the ''Vector'' class object is called as a function, it creates a new
variable-length ''Vector'' object of the requested base type, giving it the initial
length of the ''length'' property of //object// and initial element values extracted
from //object// between indices ''0'' and //object//''.length''.

<RETN> The ''Vector'' class object called as a function returns a new ''Vector'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="meta static function invoke">


== Methods on ''Vector'' instances ==

=== toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The ''toString'' method converts the vector to a ''string''.
It has the same effect as if the ''join'' method were invoked for this
object with no argument.

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function toString">

=== toLocaleString ( ) ===

<DESC> The elements of this ''Vector'' are converted to strings using
their public ''toLocaleString'' methods, and these strings are then
concatenated, separated by occurrences of a separator string that has
been derived in an implementation-defined locale-specific way.  The
result of calling this function is intended to be analogous to the
result of ''toString'', except that the result of this function is
intended to be locale-specific.

<RETN> The ''toLocaleString'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function toLocaleString">

<NOTE> The first parameter to this method is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that
implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.

=== concat ( ...items )===

<DESC> The ''concat'' method collects the vector elements from
''this'' followed by the vector elements from the additional
//items//, in order, into a new ''Vector'' object.  All the //items//
must be '''Vector'' instances with the same base type as ''this''.

<RETN> The ''concat'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object with the
same base type as ''this''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function concat">

=== every ( checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''every'' method calls //checker// on every vector
element of ''this'' in increasing index order, stopping as
soon as any call returns **false**.

<P>//Checker// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and ''this'' itself.  The //thisObj// is used as the
''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The ''every'' method returns **true** if all the calls to
//checker// returned true values, otherwise it returns **false**.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function every">

=== filter ( checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''filter'' method calls //checker// on every vector element
of ''this'' in increasing index order, collecting all the
vector elements for which checker returns a true value.

<P> //Checker// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and ''this'' itself.  The //thisObj// is used as the
''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The ''filter'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object with the
same base type as ''this'', containing the elements that were
collected, in the order they were collected.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function filter">

=== forEach ( eacher, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''forEach'' method calls //eacher// on every vector
element of ''this'' in increasing index order, discarding
any return value of //eacher//.

<P> //Eacher// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and ''this''.  The //thisObj// is used as the
''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The ''forEach'' method does not return a value.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function forEach">

=== indexOf ( value, from=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''indexOf'' method compares //value// with every
vector element of ''this'' in increasing index order,
starting at the index //from//, stopping when a vector element is
equal to //value// by the ''==='' operator.

<P> //From// is rounded toward zero before use.  If //from// is
negative, it is treated as ''this.length+//from//''.

<RETN> The static ''indexOf'' method returns the vector index the first
time //value// is equal to an element, or -1 if no such element is
found.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function indexOf">

=== join ( separator=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''join'' method concatenates the string representations of
the vector elements of ''this'' in increasing index order, separating
the individual strings by occurrences of //separator//.

<RETN> The ''join'' method returns the concatenated string.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function join">

=== lastIndexOf ( value, from=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''lastIndexOf'' method compares //value// with every
vector element of ''this'' in decreasing numerical index order,
starting at the index //from//, stopping when a vector element is
equal to //value// by the ''==='' operator.

<P> //From// is rounded toward zero before use.  If //from// is
negative, it is treated as ''this.length+//from//''.

<RETN> The ''lastIndexOf'' method returns the vector index the first
time //value// is equal to an element, or -1 if no such element is
found.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function lastIndexOf">

=== map ( mapper, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''map'' method calls //mapper// on each vector element of
''this'' in increasing numerical index order, collecting the return
values from //mapper// in a new ''Vector'' object with the same base
type as ''this''.

<P>//Mapper// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and ''this''.  The //thisObj// is used as the ''this''
object in the call.

<RETN> The ''map'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object where the
vector element at index //i// is the value returned from the call to
//mapper// on //object[i]//.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function map">

=== pop () ===

<DESC> The ''pop'' method extracts the last vector element from
''this'' and removes it by decreasing the value of the ''length''
property of ''this'' by 1.

<RETN> The static ''pop'' method returns the removed element, or
**undefined** cast to the base type of ''this'' if there are no
elements.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function pop">

=== push ( ...items ) ===

<DESC> The static ''push'' method appends the values in //items// to
the end of the vector elements of ''this'', in the order in which
they appear, in the process updating the ''length'' property of ''this''.

<RETN> The ''push'' method returns the new value of the ''length''
property of ''this''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function push">


=== reverse () ===

<DESC> The ''reverse'' method rearranges the vector elements of
''this'' so as to reverse their order.  The ''length'' property of
''this'' remains unchanged.

<RETN> The ''reverse'' method returns ''this''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function reverse">

=== shift () ===

<DESC> The ''shift'' method removes the element called ''0'' in
''this'', moves the element at index //i+1// to index //i//, and
decrements the ''length'' property of ''this'' by 1.

<RETN> The ''shift'' method returns the element that was removed.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function shift">

=== slice ( start=<LDOTS>, end=<LDOTS> )===

<DESC> The ''slice'' method extracts the subrange of array elements
from ''this'' between //start// (inclusive) and //end// (exclusive)
into a new Array.

<P> If //start// is negative, it is treated as
''//object//.length+//start//''.  If //end// is negative, it is
treated as ''//object//.length+//end//''.  In either case the values
of //start// and //end// are bounded between 0 and
''//object//.length''.

<RETN> The ''slice'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object with the
same base type as ''this'', containing the extracted vector elements.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function slice">

=== some ( checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''some'' method calls //checker// on every vector element
in ''this'' in increasing index order, stopping as soon as //checker//
returns a true value.

<P>//Checker// is called with three arguments: the property value, the
property index, and ''this''.  The //thisObj// is used as the ''this''
object in the call.

<RETN> The ''some'' method returns **true** when //checker// returns a
true value, otherwise returns **false** if all the calls to
//checker// return false values.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function some">

=== sort ( comparefn ) ===

<DESC> The ''sort'' method sorts the vector elements of
''this'' according to the ordering defined by ''comparefn''.

<P> The sort is not necessarily stable (that is, elements that compare
equal do not necessarily remain in their original order).
//Comparefn// must be a consistent (see below) function that accepts
two arguments //x// and //y// of the base type of ''this'' and returns
a negative value if //x <LT> y//, zero if //x = y//, or a positive
value if //x <GT> y//.

<FIXME> More here, but not too much more.  We should factor Array.sort so
that the good bits can reasonably be referenced from here.

<COMP> Unlike the case for ''Array'', the //comparefn// is a required argument.

<FIXME> We could provide a default comparators that would work like this:

<PRE class="FIXME">
    /* T is the base type */
    function comparator(a, b) {
       if (T is Numbers) {
         if (a < b) return -1;
         if (b < a) return 1;
         return 0;
       }
       if (T is Booleans) {
         if (!a && b) return -1;
         if (a && !b) return 1;
         return 0;
       }
       if (T is Strings) {
         if (a < b) return -1;
         if (b < a) return 1;
         return 0;
       }
       /* default behavior -- from Array.sort */
       return comparator(string(a), string(b))
    }
</PRE>

<P class="fixme"> It's kind of weird, though, to provide this.

<RETN> The ''sort'' method returns ''this''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function sort">
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="helper function sortCompare">

<NOTE> For a description of the informative ''sortEngine'' method, see
<XREF target="sortEngine">.

=== splice ( start, deleteCount, ...items ) ===

<DESC> The ''splice'' method replaces the //deleteCount// vector
elements of ''this'' starting at index //start// with values
from the //items//.

<RETN> The ''splice'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object of the
same base type as ''this'', containing the vector elements that were
removed from ''this'', in order.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function splice">

=== unshift ( ...items ) ===

<DESC> The ''unshift'' method inserts the values in //items//
as new vector elements at the start of ''this'', such that their
order within the vector elements of ''this'' is the same as the order
in which they appear in //items//.  Existing vector elements in
''this'' are shifted upward in the index range, and the ''length''
property of ''this'' is updated.

<RETN> The ''unshift'' method returns the new value of the
''length'' property of ''this''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="function unshift">


== Iteration protocol on ''Vector'' instances ==

<P> Iterators are defined on the ''Vector'' such that ''for''-''in''
and ''for each''-''in'' loops always iterate across the vector from
low indices toward high indices.

<FIXME> Elaborate this.

== Value properties of ''Vector'' instances ==

=== length ===

<P> The property ''length'' determines the range of valid indices into
the ''Vector''.  Indices up to but not including ''length''-1 are
always defined.

<P> When ''length'' is given a new value that is smaller than its old
value then the elements in the vector beyond the new length are
removed from the vector.

<P> When ''length'' is given a new value that is greater than its old
value then the elements in the vector beyond the old length are given
the value **undefined** cast to the base type ''T''.

<P> If an attempt is made to set ''length'' when the ''fixed'' property
is **true** then a **RangeError** is thrown.

<P> If an attempt is made to set ''length'' to any value that is not a
nonnegative integer less than 2<SUP>32</SUP> then a **RangeError** is
thrown.


=== fixed ===

<P> The boolean property ''fixed'' determines whether the ''Vector''
has a fixed length.

<P> If ''fixed'' has the value **true** then any attempt to change
''length'' will result in in a **RangeError** being thrown.

<P> The value of ''fixed'' is not constant, so vectors can be of fixed
length and variable length at different times.


=== Numerically named properties ===

<P> A ''Vector'' contains all properties whose names are nonnegative
integers below the value of ''length''.

<P> If an attempt is made to read a property whose name is a number that
is not a nonnegative integer below ''length'' then a **RangeError** is thrown.

<P> If an attempt is made to write a property whose name is a number that is not
a nonnegative integer below ''length'' then one of two things happen:
<UL>
  <LI> If the ''fixed'' property has the value ''true'', or if the
  number is not a nonnegative integer, or if it is a nonnegative number but
  not the value ''length''+1, or if ''length'' is already uint.MAX_VALUE,
  then a **RangeError** is thrown.
  <LI> Otherwise, the property is defined on the vector and the ''length'' property
  is incremented by 1.
</UL>
