CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 1 (2008-03-03)

  * Presentation: added an explicit "extends Object" clause.

  * Bug fixes based on comments on es4-discuss


KNOWN DISCREPANCIES AGAINST PROPOSALS

  * Proposals call for a method 'setSlice' supposedly specified in
    JS1.8.  But the JS1.8 docs do not define it.


OPEN ISSUES

  * Should 'filter', 'map', and 'slice' return a vector whose 'fixed'
    property is true if the 'fixed' property of the vector they were
    generated from is true?


NOTES

  * The proposal uses the phrase "default value appropriate to the
    base type T" in a few places.  This is the value 0 for numeric
    types; the empty string for string types; false for boolean types;
    undefined for the undefined type; and null for all other types.
    A function that takes a type object and computes the correct
    default value is expressible in ES4 and may be incorporated
    into the library spec later.

  * No namespaces are explicitly opened in the scope surrounding the
    definition of Vector.  If the normative fragments do not show an
    explicit qualification on a name then the name referenced is the
    public one.

  * As a general rule, when invoking methods on objects passed as
    arguments, the Vector methods (like other methods in the library)
    invoke public methods on the received objects.  For example, the
    'toLocaleString' method is careful to call the public
    'toLocaleString' method on its arguments, and 'every', 'filter',
    'forEach', 'map', and so on call the public 'call' methods on
    their function arguments.

<P> The class ''Vector'' is a parameterized, dynamic, direct subclass
of ''Object''.  It represents dense, typed, 0-based, one-dimensional
arrays with bounds checking and optionally fixed length.

<P> The class ''Vector'' provides two benefits.  One is optimization:
the restrictions placed on the class---denseness and a predefined
iteration order---make it possible for ECMAScript implementations to
implement it particularly efficiently.  The other is error checking:
''Vector'' provides stronger type checking and bounds checking than
''Array''.

<COMP> The class ''Vector'' is new in the 4th Edition of this
Standard.

<P> The class ''Vector'' provides a method suite that is largely
compatible with the class ''Array''.

<NOTE> It is likely that many current uses of ''Array'' can be
switched over to ''Vector'' without much work, and programs that can
be switched will receive the benefits of stronger type and bounds
checking.

<P> The type parameter of the ''Vector'' is called its //base type//.

<P> As the ''Vector'' class is dynamic, new properties can be added to
its instances but any property whose name is a number (an instance of
any class in the union type ''AnyNumber'') is handled specially.
These properties are called //indexed properties//.

<P> Only indexed properties named by nonnegative integers less than
the value of the property ''length'' are defined, and only indexed
properties named by nonnegative integers less than 2<SUP>32</SUP>-1
can be defined.

<P> Any attempt to read an undefined indexed property results in a
**RangeError** exception being thrown.

<P> Any attempt to write an undefined indexed property results in a
**RangeError** being thrown unless the index is equal to the current
value of ''length'', the current value of ''length'' is not
2<SUP>32</SUP>-1, and the value of the property ''fixed'' is not
**true**.

<P> The property ''fixed'' is a flag that determines whether the
vector has fixed length or not.  Any attempt to update the value of
''length'' fails if the ''fixed'' property has the value **true**.

<NOTE> If ''v'' is a ''Vector'' then reading and writing ''v[3.14]''
or ''v[-3]'' will always fail, though reading and writing
''v["3.14"]'' or ''v["-3"]'' will succeed.  

<P class="note"> This behavior deviates from the 3rd Edition, where
strings and numbers are interchangeable as property names.  But that's
no longer quite true in 4th Edition anyway, which has have namespaces
and ''Name'' objects.

<P class="note">Most attempts to set or get properties that are named
by numbers that are not valid array indices are probably errors,
especially if the object is an Array.  Most attempts to read beyond
the end of an Array are probably errors.  And in a number of cases,
attempts to write beyond the end of an Array are probably errors too.
The ''Vector'' class makes it possible to discover these errors.

<P> All indexed properties named by nonnegative integers less than
''length'' are always defined.

<NOTE> As a consequence, a ''Vector'' does not have "holes" in its
index range in the way an ''Array'' does.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Vector'' provides the following interface:

== Methods on the ''Vector'' class object ==

=== new Vector.&lt;T&gt; ( length=<LDOTS>, fixed=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''Vector'' constructor initializes a new ''Vector'' object.

<P> //Length// is the inital value of the ''length'' property.  Its
default value is zero.  Every indexed element of the new vector below
//length// is initialized to a default value that is appropriate to
the base type ''T''.

<P> //Fixed// is the initial value of the ''fixed'' property.  Its
default value is **false**.


<!-- I believe this is not what we want 
=== Vector( object ) ===

<DESC> When the ''Vector'' class object is called as a function, it
creates a new variable-length ''Vector'' object of type ''*'', giving
it the initial length of the ''length'' property of //object// and
initial element values extracted from //object// between indices ''0''
and //object//''.length''.

<RETN> The ''Vector'' class object called as a function returns a new
''Vector'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="static meta function invoke">
-->


== Methods on ''Vector'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts the vector to a ''string''.
It has the same effect as if the ''join'' method were invoked for this
object with no argument.

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

=== intrinsic::toLocaleString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toLocaleString'' method converts the ''Vector''
to a string in the following manner.

<P>Elements of this ''Vector'' are converted to strings using their
public ''toLocaleString'' methods, and these strings are then
concatenated, separated by occurrences of a separator string that has
been derived in an implementation-defined locale-specific way.  The
result of calling this function is intended to be analogous to the
result of ''toString'', except that the result of this function is
intended to be locale-specific.

<RETN> The ''toLocaleString'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="override intrinsic function toLocaleString">

<NOTE> The first parameter to this method is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that
implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.

=== intrinsic::concat ( ...items ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''concat'' method collects the vector elements
from ''this'' followed by the vector elements from the additional
//items//, in order, into a new ''Vector'' object.  All the //items//
must be ''Vector'' instances whose base types are subtypes of the base
type of ''this''.

<RETN> The ''concat'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object with the
same base type as ''this''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function concat">
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="helper function concat">

<FIXME> Need to check a detail of the type system, namely whether
''Vector.&lt;T&gt;'' is a subtype of Vector.&lt;U&gt; if T is a
subtype of U and U is not ''*''.

=== intrinsic::every ( checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''every'' method calls //checker// on every
vector element of ''this'' in increasing index order, stopping as soon
as any call returns **false**.

<P>//Checker// is called with three arguments: the vector element
value, the vector element index, and ''this''.  //ThisObj// is used as
the ''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The ''every'' method returns **true** if all the calls to
//checker// returned true values, otherwise it returns **false**.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function every">

=== intrinsic::filter ( checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''filter'' method calls //checker// on every
vector element of ''this'' in increasing index order, collecting all
the vector elements for which checker returns a true value.

<P> //Checker// is called with three arguments: the vector element
value, the vector element index, and ''this''.  //ThisObj// is used as
the ''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The ''filter'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object with the
same base type as ''this'', containing the elements that were
collected, in the order they were collected.  The length of the new
''Vector'' is equal to the number of values that were collected.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function filter">

=== intrinsic::forEach ( eacher, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''forEach'' method calls //eacher// on every
vector element of ''this'' in increasing index order, discarding any
return value of //eacher//.

<P> //Eacher// is called with three arguments: the vector element
value, the vector element index, and ''this''.  //ThisObj// is used as
the ''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The ''forEach'' method does not return a value.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function forEach">

=== intrinsic::indexOf ( value, from=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''indexOf'' method compares //value// with every
vector element of ''this'' in increasing index order, starting at the
index //from//, stopping when a vector element is equal to //value//
by the ''==='' operator.

<P> If //from// is negative, it is treated as
''this.length+//from//''.

<RETN> The ''indexOf'' method returns the vector index the first
time //value// is equal to an element, or -1 if no such element is
found.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function indexOf">

<P> The helper function ''clamp'' performs clamping of ''from'' to the
length of this ''Vector''.

<INCLUDE file="Array.es" name="helper function clamp">

<NOTE> The helper function ''toInteger'', used by ''clamp'', is
described elsewhere; it performs the ''ToInteger'' operation of the
3rd Edition.

=== intrinsic::join ( separator=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''join'' method concatenates the string
representations of the vector elements of ''this'' in increasing index
order, separating the individual strings by occurrences of
//separator//.

<RETN> The ''join'' method returns the concatenated string.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function join">

=== intrinsic::lastIndexOf ( value, from=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''lastIndexOf'' method compares //value// with every
vector element of ''this'' in decreasing numerical index order,
starting at the index //from//, stopping when a vector element is
equal to //value// by the ''==='' operator.

<P> If //from// is negative, it is treated as
''this.length+//from//''.

<RETN> The ''lastIndexOf'' method returns the vector index the first
time //value// is equal to an element, or -1 if no such element is
found.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function lastIndexOf">

=== intrinsic::map ( mapper, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''map'' method calls //mapper// on each vector
element of ''this'' in increasing numerical index order, collecting
the return values from //mapper//.

<P>//Mapper// is called with three arguments: the vector element
value, the vector element index, and ''this''.  //ThisObj// is used as
the ''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The ''map'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object of the same
base type and length as this ''Vector''.  The element at index //i//
in the new vector is the value collected from the call to //mapper//
on ''this[''//i//'']''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function map">

=== intrinsic::pop () ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''pop'' method extracts the last vector element
from ''this'' and removes it by decreasing the value of the ''length''
property of ''this'' by 1.

<RETN> The ''pop'' method returns the removed element, or the
appropriate default value for the base type of ''this'' if there are
no elements.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function pop">

=== intrinsic::push ( ...items ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''push'' method appends the values in //items//
to this ''Vector'', in the order in which they appear in //items//.
The ''length'' property of this ''Vector'' will be incremented by the
length of //items//.

<RETN> The ''push'' method returns the new value of the ''length''
property of this ''Vector''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function push">
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="helper function push">


=== intrinsic::reverse () ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''reverse'' method rearranges the vector elements of
''this'' so as to reverse their order.  The ''length'' property of
''this'' remains unchanged.

<RETN> The ''reverse'' method returns ''this''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function reverse">

=== intrinsic::shift () ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''shift'' method removes the element called ''0'' in
''this'', moves the element at index //i+1// to index //i//, and
decrements the ''length'' property of ''this'' by 1.

<RETN> The ''shift'' method returns the element that was removed.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function shift">

=== intrinsic::slice ( start=<LDOTS>, end=<LDOTS>, step=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''slice'' method extracts the subrange of array
elements from ''this'' between //start// (inclusive) and //end//
(exclusive) into a new Array.  Each //step// element is taken.

<P> The default value of //start// is 0.  If it is negative, it is
treated as ''//object//.length+//start//''.

<P> The default value of //end// is Infinity.  If it is negative, it
is treated as ''//object//.length+//end//''.

<P> The default value of //step// is 1.  If it is 0, it is set to 1.

<RETN> The ''slice'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object with the
same base type as ''this'', containing the extracted vector elements.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function slice">

=== intrinsic::some ( checker, thisObj=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''some'' method calls //checker// on every vector
element in ''this'' in increasing index order, stopping as soon as
//checker// returns a true value.

<P>//Checker// is called with three arguments: the vector element
value, the vector element index, and ''this''.  //ThisObj// is used as
the ''this'' object in the call.

<RETN> The ''some'' method returns **true** when //checker// returns a
true value, otherwise returns **false** if all the calls to
//checker// return false values.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function some">

=== intrinsic::sort ( comparefn ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic::''sort'' method sorts the vector elements of
''this'' according to the ordering defined by ''comparefn''.

<P> The sort is not necessarily stable (that is, elements that compare
equal do not necessarily remain in their original order).
//Comparefn// must be a consistent (see <XREF target="sorting-logic">)
function that accepts two arguments //x// and //y// of the base type
of ''this'' and returns a negative value if //x <LT> y//, zero if //x
= y//, or a positive value if //x <GT> y//.

<COMP> Unlike the case for ''Array'', the //comparefn// is a required argument.

<FIXME> (Ticket #197.) Should we provide a default comparator?

<RETN> The ''sort'' method returns ''this''.

<IMPL>
The ''sort'' method calls on the generic sorting engine, passing a
function to compare elements of //this//.

<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function sort">

<NOTE> For a description of the informative ''sortEngine'' method, see
<XREF target="sorting-logic">.

<FIXME> The signature of ''comparefn'' is probably too constraining,
it will require the client to pass a strongly-typed function.

=== intrinsic::splice ( start, deleteCount, ...items ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''splice'' method replaces the //deleteCount// vector
elements of ''this'' starting at index //start// with values
from the //items//.

<RETN> The ''splice'' method returns a new ''Vector'' object of the
same base type as ''this'', containing the vector elements that were
removed from ''this'', in order.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function splice">
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="helper function splice">

=== intrinsic::unshift ( ...items ) ===

<DESC> The instrinsic ''unshift'' method inserts the values in
//items// as new vector elements at the start of ''this'', such that
their order within the vector elements of ''this'' is the same as the
order in which they appear in //items//.  Existing vector elements in
''this'' are shifted upward in the index range, and the ''length''
property of ''this'' is updated.

<RETN> The ''unshift'' method returns the new value of the
''length'' property of ''this''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="intrinsic function unshift">
<INCLUDE file="Vector.es" name="helper function unshift">


== Iteration protocol on ''Vector'' instances ==

<P> Iterators are defined on the ''Vector'' such that ''for''-''in''
and ''for each''-''in'' loops always iterate across the vector from
low indices toward high indices.  Only indexed properties defined 
directly on the vector object are visited.

== Value properties of ''Vector'' instances ==

=== length ===

<P> The property ''length'' determines the range of valid indices into
the ''Vector''.  Indices up to but not including ''length'' are always
defined.

<P> When ''length'' is given a new value that is smaller than its old
value then the elements in the vector at the new length and beyond are
removed from the vector.

<P> When ''length'' is given a new value that is greater than its old
value then the elements in the vector at the old length and beyond are
given a default value that is appropriate to the base type ''T''.

<P> If an attempt is made to set ''length'' when the ''fixed'' property
is **true** then a **RangeError** is thrown.

<P> If an attempt is made to set ''length'' to any value that is not a
nonnegative integer less than 2<SUP>32</SUP> then a **RangeError** is
thrown.


=== fixed ===

<P> The boolean property ''fixed'' determines whether the ''Vector''
has fixed length.

<P> If ''fixed'' has the value **true** then any attempt to change
''length'' will result in in a **RangeError** being thrown.

<P> The value of ''fixed'' is not constant, so vectors can be of fixed
length and variable length at different times.


=== Numerically named properties ===

<P> A ''Vector'' contains all properties whose names are nonnegative
integers below the value of the ''Vector'''s ''length'' property.

<P> If an attempt is made to read a property whose name is a number that
is not a nonnegative integer below ''length'' then a **RangeError** is thrown.

<P> If an attempt is made to write a property whose name is a number that is not
a nonnegative integer below ''length'' then one of two things happen:
<UL>
  <LI> If the ''fixed'' property has the value ''true'', or if the
  number is not a nonnegative integer, or if the number is nonnegative but
  not the same value as the value of ''length'', or if ''length'' is 
  already 2<SUP>32</SUP>-1, then a **RangeError** is thrown.

  <LI> Otherwise, the property is defined on the vector and 
  the ''length'' property is incremented by 1.
</UL>

== Methods on the ''Vector'' prototype object ==

<DESC> The methods on the ''Vector'' prototype object perform a small
amount of type conversion and delegate to the corresponding intrinsic
methods.

<RETN> The methods on the ''Vector'' prototype object return what their
corresponding intrinsic methods return.
