= Tutorial Introduction to the ES4 Library Draft =

<P> The ES4 library specification is expressed partly in terms of ES4
fragments: the specification uses executable -- and testable -- ES4
code in places where the ES3 specification uses pseudocode.  As a
consequence, the draft library specification makes some assumptions
about what ES4 will look like when it is finished.

<P> This guide contains an outline of some aspects of ES4 that it will
be necessary for the reader of the draft specification to know, beyond
what is in ES3.  Details are presented in the language definition part
of the Specification.

<P> This guide will not be a part of the final ES4 specification.


== Namespaces, names ==

<P> ES4 places all names in namespaces.  A name is in exactly one
namespace and it is placed in that namespace by prefixing a binding
keyword (''class'', ''var'', ''const'', ''function'', and others) with
the namespace name.  If ''MyNS'' is a namespace then

{{{
    MyNS var x 
}}}

creates a variable whose fully qualified name is ''MyNS::x''.  The
latter syntax can also be used to create namespaced dynamic properties
on objects:

{{{

   obj.MyNS::x = 37
}}}

<P> There are several pre-defined namespaces.  The namespace
''__ES4__'' is used for all top-level names that are new to ES4 if
they're not in one of the other namespaces.  Important pre-defined
namespaces are ''__ES4__::intrinsic'' and ''__ES4__::reflect''.

<P> (Two new names are not in any of the new namespaces: ''__ES4__''
and ''__ECMASCRIPT_VERSION__'' are both in the //compatibility namespace//,
which is a pre-defined "empty" namespace.  All top-level bindings defined
by ES3, as well as all prototype properties, are in the compatibility
namespace.)

<P> In order to avoid having to fully qualify names all the time,
namespaces can be //opened//; the names defined in the namespace will
then be available without qualificiation.  The namespace ''__ES4__''
is opened for all ES4 code, so in practice the two pre-defined
namespaces listed above are known just as ''intrinsic'' and
''reflect''.

<P> Opening a namespace may introduce an ambiguity in that an
unqualified name may reference two different bindings.  The ambiguity
can be resolved by fully qualifying ambiguous names.  (Ambiguities are
not common because a namespace opened in an inner lexical scope takes
precedence over namespaces opened in outer scopes.)

<P> The ''intrinsic'' namespace is reserved; user code is not allowed
to introduce new names in this namespace.  The ''intrinsic'' namespace
is used primarily for methods in the pre-defined classes.  For every
prototype method //M// there is a corresponding intrinsic method //M//
in the class.  For example, there is ''Array.prototype.concat'' and
also an ''intrinsic::concat'' method on ''Array'' instances.  The
prototype methods are fully compatible with ES3 in the types they
accept and how they convert values.  The intrinsic methods normally
have more tightly constrained signatures and, like all class methods,
are immutable (though they can be overridden in subclasses -- that's
allowed even for user code).

<P> The ''intrinsic'' namespace provides integrity (code that calls an
intrinsic method will know that it references the original method, it
is not at the mercy of changes to the prototype method) and
optimization opportunities (early binding to the slot that holds the
method in the presence of type annotations).

<P> The specification of the pre-defined classes in terms of ES4 code
makes use of other pre-defined classes and their methods, and
pre-defined methods are careful to call intrinsic methods to invoke
known behavior and to call public methods to invoke explicitly variant
behavior.  Normally, such invocations are always explicitly qualified
in the text in order to avoid any ambiguity in the reader's mind.

== Name lookup ==

<P> The lookup rules for object properties is such that dynamic
properties cannot shadow fixed properties, and properties defined in
subclasses cannot shadow properties that are statically visible from
the base class.

<P> The language uses lexical block scope, and as a general rule (and
absent uses of ''eval'', ''with'', and certain dynamic name forms) a
name expression references the innermost statically visible binding
of that name.


== Types and annotations ==

<P> Bindings in ES4 are typed, and a type annotation can be provided
explicitly in the definition of a binding by following the binding's
name with a colon and the type:

{{{
    var x: Array
}}}

<P> If the type is omitted, it is "*" (read as "any"), which means the
binding has no type constraint.  If we assume just run-time type
checking, then a check is performed every time a value is stored into
an annotated variable: the type of the value must be a subtype of the
annotated type.

<P> Functions can be annotated as well, in both their parameter and
return positions.  Annotations on parameters constrain how the
function can be called.  Annotations in the return position constrains
what the function can return:

{{{
    function f(x: string): RegExp { ... }
}}}

<P> There are two classes of types, nominal types and structural
types.

<P> Nominal types are introduced by class definitions and interface
definitions.  Values of nominal types are created by instantiating
classes (using the "new" operator).  The syntax and semantics are
broadly as in Java: A nominal type is equal only to itself; a value is
of a class type only if it was instantiated from that type; and it is
of an interface type only if it was instantiated from a class type
that declares that it implements that interface.  (Unlike in Java, the
access control keywords such as ''private'' and ''public'' are
actually aliases for language-provided namespaces.)

<P> Methods on classes appear as function definitions in the class
body.  The class instance is in scope in the body of a method, as is
the class object (holding the static properties).

<P> Classes can be tagged as ''dynamic'', in which case properties can
be added to instances of the class at run-time.

<P> Classes and methods can be tagged ''final'', in which case the
class can't be subclassed or the method can't be overridden.

<P> Structural types are record types (for example ''{x:int,y:int}''),
array types (for example ''[int]''), tuple types (for example
''[int,string]''), union types (for example ''(int|string|RegExp)''),
function types (for example ''function(int):boolean)'', and some
special types (''null'' and ''undefined'').  A structural type is
equal to any other structural type that has the same fields with the
same types (in any order), and a value is of a structural type if it
has fixed (non-deletable) fields with the names and types given by the
structural type.  (So if ''Point'' is a class with ''x'' and ''y''
integer fields, an instance of ''Point'' is of the structural type
''{x:int,y:int}''.)  Structural types can't be recursive.

<P> Types can be given names by type definitions:

{{{
    type Num = (int|double)
}}}

<P> Type definitions, class definitions, and interface definitions can
be parameterized:

{{{
    class Map.<K,V> { ... }
    type Box.<T> = { value: T }
}}}

<P> Record and array types are instantiated by suffixing the literal
with the type:

{{{
    { value: 7 } : Box.<int>
    [1,2,3] : [int]
}}}

<P> Any type is a subtype of ''*'', and ''Box.&lt;T&gt;'' is a subtype of
''Box.&lt;*&gt;'', for any T.

<P> One of the important aspecs of the type system is that the types
provide a specification for fixed properties on the objects that are
of the type: in any value of type ''Box.&lt;T&gt;'', the ''value'' property
can't be removed.


== Functions ==

<P> Functions can take optional arguments (they have default values)
and rest arguments:

{{{
    function f(x, y=0) { ... }   // y is optional
    function f(x, ...rest) { ... }
}}}

<P> The rest argument appears as a regular ''Array'' object holding
the excess parameter values.

<P> Function bodies that contain a simple return statement (which
typically returns the result of a call to another function) are
common; ES4 introduces a shorthand -- extensively used in the library
draft specifications -- where the body is a brace-less expression:

{{{
    function f(x, y)
      g(x*2, y, 0)
}}}


== Informative and helper methods ==

<P> The library specification is normative, which means the ES4 code
in the specification is normative too.  In order to avoid
overspecification, non-normative sections of code have been factored
out as methods in the ''informative'' namespace.  The informative
methods are always described by prose.  A good example is the global
hashcode function:

{{{
    intrinsic const function hashcode(o): double {
        switch type (o) {
        case (x: null)       { return 0 }
        case (x: undefined)  { return 0 }
        case (x: AnyBoolean) { return Number(x) }
        case (x: AnyNumber)  { return intrinsic::toUint(x) }
        case (x: AnyString)  { return informative::stringHash(x) }
        case (x: Namespace)  { return informative::namespaceHash(x) }
        case (x: Name)       { return informative::nameHash(x) }
        case (x: *)          { return informative::objectHash(x) }
        }
    }
}}}

<P> Hashing on **null**, **undefined**, booleans, and numbers is
normatively specified, but hashing on strings, names, namespaces, and
other objects is only informatively specified.

<P> In order to share code, the specification also factors out
commonalities as methods in the ''helper'' namespace.  A common case
is where both prototype methods and intrinsic methods take a variable
number of arguments, as for the concat method in ''Array'':

        prototype function concat(...items)
            Array.helper::concat(this, items);

        intrinsic function concat(...items): Array
            Array.helper::concat(this, items);

<P> (In this case the ''helper'' function is a static method on the
''Array'' class, because that accomodates the static ''concat'' method
too.)

<P> The ''private'' namespace is sometimes used in a manner similar to
the ''helper'' namespace.  (Often the choice between ''private'' and
''helper'' seems arbitrary.  As a general rule, ''private'' is used
for auxiliary instance methods, and ''helper'' is used for auxiliary
static methods and global functions.  This rule is not being
consistently followed at present, but that will be cleaned up
eventually.)

<P> The ''helper'' and ''private'' functions //are normative// in the
sense that they define the detailed functionality of a method, eg in
the order of operations on a data structure.  But ''helper'' functions
are not visible in a real implementation, they are not part of the
API, and a real implementation does not reserve the ''helper''
namespace.  (Of course ''private'' functions are not visible in real
implementations either.)

<P> In a similar manner, the prose description for an ''informative''
functions defines its functionality normatively but leaves the
implementation more room for variations.  The ''informative''
functions are not visible in a real implementation, they are not part
of the API, and a real implementation does not reserve the
''implementation'' namespace.

<P> A final constraint on ''informative'' functions is that they do
not call program-visible (i.e., public, protected, intrinsic, reflect,
meta, iterator, or prototype) methods on their ''this'' object except
when explicitly specified to do so.


== Meta-level methods ==

<P> The pre-defined namespace "meta" is used for methods that
participate in language-level protocols: invocation, property access,
and property update.  A class that defines a ''meta::invoke'' fixture
is callable as a function (the ''meta::invoke'' method is invoked in
response to the call); the ''meta::get'', ''meta::set'',
''meta::has'', and ''meta::delete'' methods are invoked in response to
accesses to all dynamic properties on the object, and respectively
read a property value, update a property, query the existence of a
property, and remove a property.

<P> The meta methods have have static and instance forms.  This is
particularly prominent for ''meta::invoke''.  Given a class ''Cls''
with a static ''meta::invoke'' method:

{{{
    class Cls { 
        static meta function invoke(...)
        ... 
    }
}}}

you can call ''Cls'' as a function:

{{{
    x = y + Cls(z);
}}}

<P> This is used by many classes to implement converters to the class
type.

<P> Given a class ''Cls'' with an instance ''meta::invoke'' method:

{{{
    class Cls {
        meta function invoke(...) ... 
    }
}}}

then it is the instances of ''Cls'' that are themselves callable:

{{{
    c = new Cls;
    x = y + c(z);
}}}

<P> This is used in some instances to make arbitrary objects callable,
and is used to model the fact that instances of Functions are
themselves callable as functions.


== magic ==

<P> The specification makes use of a pre-defined namespace "magic".
This namespace is reserved in the specification but not in any actual
implementation of the language.  It is used only to tag top-level
functions that are implementation hooks.  The hooks provide
functionality that is not available in the language, for example,
accessing the internal [[Prototype]] property of objects.

<P> Magic functions are defined by prose for the moment; it is likely
that they will be (at least partly) exposed as Standard ML fragments
later, in the style of the semantic functions we're planning for other
parts of the specification.


== Non-nullable types, primitive types ==

<P> Occasionally in the library draft specification you will see an
exclamation point added to the end of a type expression:

{{{
    class Namespace {
        static meta function invoke(x): Namespace! 
            ....
    }
}}}

<P> The exclamation point indicates a "non-nullable reference", ie, in
this case that the value returned may never be **null**.  Similar
annotations are used for parameter types in some cases.

<P> The primitive types of the language are the classes ''string'',
''boolean'', and ''double''.  These correspond to the primitive types
in ES3.  They are non-nullable types; that is, a function returning
''string'' will never return **null**.
