= ByteArray Objects =

<P>A ''ByteArray'' object is a container for an indexable, dense,
mutable, and extensible sequence of unsigned integer values in the
value range 0 through 255.

<NOTE>ByteArray objects are motivated by efficiency: They are likely
to use less storage and to be faster than Array objects.

<FIXME>Why is this class ''intrinsic''?  It should be enough for it to
be ''__ES4__'' for it to be hidden.

<COMP>The ''ByteArray'' class is new in 4th Edition.

<COMP>The ''ByteArray'' class in 4th Edition is compatible with the
''ByteArray'' class in ActionScript <CITE ref="ActionScript manual">
in the sense that it does not define any methods that conflict with
methods defined by the latter (as of ActionScript 3 and Adobe Flex 2).

== Construction ==

=== The ByteArray Class Called as a Function ===

<P> This creates a new ByteArray and then populates it with data from
the argument(s).

<FIXME> The following is a proposal.

<P> If the argument is anything with a "length" property, then
elements from 0 through length-1 are extracted.  If an element is a string then
its first character code is extracted.  If an element is numeric then it is converted to uint().
(If neither string nor numeric an exception is thrown.)
Finally the low 8 bits of the value are appended to the ByteArray.

<P> There can be arbitrarily many arguments.


=== The ByteArray Constructor ===


=== Creating ByteArrays from Strings ===

<FIXME> I vote that we remove this, ByteArray(string) does the same job

=== Creating ByteArrays from Objects ===

<FIXME> I vote that we remove this, ByteArray(array) does the same job
