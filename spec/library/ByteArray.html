<P> The class ''ByteArray'' is a final, non-dynamic, nullable, direct
subclass of ''Object''.  It is a container for an indexable, dense,
0-based, mutable, and extensible sequence of unsigned integer values
in the value range 0 through 255 ("bytes").

<NOTE> ''ByteArray'' objects are motivated by efficiency: They are
likely to use less storage and to be faster than ''Array'' or
''Vector'' objects.

<COMP>The ''ByteArray'' class is new in 4th Edition.

<COMP> The ''ByteArray'' class in 4th Edition is compatible with the
''ByteArray'' class in ActionScript (<CITE ref="ActionScript manual"></CITE>)
in the sense that it does not define any methods that conflict with
methods defined by the latter (as of ActionScript 3 and Adobe Flex 2).


== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''ByteArray'' provides the following interface:

{{{
__ES4__ final class ByteArray
{
    <SIGNATURE file="ByteArray.es" name="function ByteArray">
    <SIGNATURE file="ByteArray.es" name="meta static function invoke">

    <SIGNATURE file="ByteArray.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

    <SIGNATURE file="ByteArray.es" name="function get length">
    <SIGNATURE file="ByteArray.es" name="function set length">
    <SIGNATURE file="ByteArray.es" name="meta function get">
    <SIGNATURE file="ByteArray.es" name="meta function set">
}
}}}

<P> The ''ByteArray'' prototype object provides the following direct properties:

{{{
    toString: function () <LDOTS>
}}}


== Methods on the ''ByteArray'' class object ==

=== new ByteArray ( length=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''ByteArray'' constructor initializes a new ''ByteArray''
object.  The //length// is the initial value of the object's
//length// property.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="ByteArray.es" name="function ByteArray">

=== ByteArray( value ) ===

<DESC> The ''ByteArray'' class object called as a function converts
//value// to ''ByteArray''.  If //value// is a ''ByteArray'' then it
is returned unchanged.  Otherwise a new ''ByteArray'' is created and
initialized from the contents of //value//: Every property value of
//value// between 0 and //value//''.length'' is extracted and
converted to number, and that number's low byte is stored in the new
''ByteArray''.

<RETN> The ''ByteArray'' function returns a ''ByteArray''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="ByteArray.es" name="meta static function invoke">


== Methods on ''ByteArray'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts a ''ByteArray'' to a
string.  The string representation is the concatenation of the decimal
representations of all the values in the ''ByteArray'', separated by
the comma character (''","'').

<RETN> The ''toString'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="ByteArray.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

== Value properties of ''ByteArray'' instances ==

=== length ===

<P> The property ''length'' determines the range of valid indices into
the ''ByteArray''.  Its value is always an unsigned integer.

<P> When ''length'' is given a new value that is smaller than its old
value then the elements in the ''ByteArray'' at the new length and
beyond are removed from the ''ByteArray''.

<P> When ''length'' is given a new value that is greater than its old
value then the elements in the ''ByteArray'' at the old length and
beyond are given the value 0.

<P> If an attempt is made to set ''length'' to any value that is not a
nonnegative integer less than 2<SUP>32</SUP> then a **RangeError** is
thrown.

=== Numerically named properties ===

<P> A ''ByteArray'' contains all properties whose names are
nonnegative integers below the value of ''length''.

<P> If an attempt is made to write a property whose //name// is a
number that is a number then ''length'' is set to the value of that
number plus one (this may fail as described above), and the property
at that name is assigned the low byte of the //value// converted to
number.

== Methods on the ''ByteArray'' prototype object ==

=== toString ( ) ===

<RETN> The ''toString'' prototype method calls its intrinsic
counterpart and returns the result of that call.

<SHORTIMPL>
