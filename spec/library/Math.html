<P> The global ''Math'' object is a single object that has some named
properties, some of which are functions.  The ''Math'' object is the
only instance of a helper class called ''Math''.

<P> The ''Math'' object acts as a container for built-in
mathematics-related functions and constants.


== Synopsis ==

<P> For convenience of notation the definition of the Math object uses
the private type names ''AnyNumber'' and ''FloatNumber''.

{{{
type AnyNumber = (int,uint,double,decimal);
type FloatNumber = (double,decimal);
}}}

<P> The intrinsic methods on the math object are restricted to
arguments of the type ''AnyNumber''.

<P> The ''Math'' object provides the following interface:

    const PI: double = double.PI
    const SQRT1_2: double = double.SQRT1_2
    const SQRT2: double = double.SQRT2
}
}}}

<P> The constant values ''E'', ''LN10'', ''LN2'', ''LOG2E'',
''LOG10E'', ''PI'', ''SQRT1_2'', and ''SQRT2'' in the ''Math'' class
are of type ''double'' for compatibility with 3rd Edition.

<NOTE> New code may find it more convenient to access these constant
values through the ''double'' or ''decimal'' classes, as appropriate,
to obtain values with the best precision for the particular type.

<P> The ''Math'' object additionally provides the following dynamic
function properties.  These functions are not restricted in the types
of arguments they accept, but convert all their arguments to number.

{{{
    abs:    function (x) <LDOTS> ,
    acos:   function (x) <LDOTS> ,
    asin:   function (x) <LDOTS> ,
    atan:   function (x) <LDOTS> ,
    atan2:  function (y,x) <LDOTS> ,
    ceil:   function (x) <LDOTS> ,
    cos:    function (x) <LDOTS> ,

    sqrt:   function (x) <LDOTS> ,
    tan:    function (x) <LDOTS>
}}}

<P> The [[Prototype]] object of the ''Math'' object does not contain a
''constructor'' property.

<FIXME> The constraint on ''constructor'' is for backward
compatibility and is also necessary to insure that the math object is
a singleton object.  But note that ''Math.constructor'' is still defined,
it is accessible through the prototype chain and is ''Object.constructor''.


== Primitive operations on numbers ==

<FIXME> Describe the following helper and informative functions here:
copysign, sign, isPositive, isPositiveZero, isNegativeZero,
isOddInteger, coerceToCommonFloating.  Or describe them in the chapter
on numbers.


== Intrinsic function properties of the Math object ==

<P> In the function descriptions below, the symbols NaN, -0, +0, -<INFINITY>
and +<INFINITY> refer to the number values described in 8.5.

<FIXME> Clean up the buggy cross-reference later.

<NOTE> The behaviour of the functions ''acos'', ''asin'', ''atan'',
''atan2'', ''cos'', ''exp'', ''log'', ''pow'', ''sin'', and ''sqrt''
is not precisely specified here except to require specific results for
certain argument values that represent boundary cases of interest. For
other argument values, these functions are intended to compute
approximations to the results of familiar mathematical functions, but
some latitude is allowed in the choice of approximation
algorithms. The general intent is that an implementer should be able
to use the same mathematical library for ECMAScript on a given
hardware platform that is available to C programmers on that platform.

<P class="note"> Although the choice of algorithms is left to the
implementation, it is recommended (but not specified by this standard)
that implementations use the approximation algorithms for IEEE 754
arithmetic contained in fdlibm, the freely distributable mathematical
library from Sun Microsystems (''fdlibm-comment@sunpro.eng.sun.com'').
This specification also requires specific results for certain argument
values that represent boundary cases of interest.

<NOTE> The functions defined in this section preserve the
representation of the argument(s) in the result where this is
reasonable.  The functions ''ceil'', ''floor'', ''pow'', and ''sqrt''
produce ''int'' and ''uint'' results when their arguments are ''int''
or ''uint'' values and the result is representable as ''int'' or
''uint''.  All functions map ''double'' and ''decimal'' arguments to
''double'' and ''decimal'' results, respectively.

<DESC>The intrinsic ''abs'' function computes the absolute value of
the number //x//, which has the same magnitude as //x// but has

<RETN>The intrinsic ''abs'' function returns the absolute value of
//x//.  The representation of the result is the same as the
representation of //x// except that the absolute value of an ''int''
may be represented as a ''uint''.

implementation-dependent approximation to the arc tangent of the
quotient //y/x// of the numbers //y// and //x//, where the signs of
//y// and //x// are used to determine the quadrant of the result.
Note that it is intentional and traditional for the two-argument arc
tangent function that the argument named //y// be first and the
argument named //x// be second. The result is expressed in radians and
ranges from -<PI> to +<PI>.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''atan2'' function returns a floating-point
number.  The result is ''decimal'' of //y// or //x// is ''decimal'',

to represent the result if //x// and //y// are both ''int'' or
''uint'' and //y// is nonnegative, and //x<SUP>y</SUP>// is
representable in the representation of //x//.  Following the rules for
arithmetic, ''int'' results overflow to a ''uint'' or ''double'' as

strategy. This function takes no arguments.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''random'' function returns a ''double''.

<IMPL> The intrinsic ''random'' function is implementation-dependent.

=== intrinsic::round (x) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''round'' function computes the number value that
is closest to //x// and is equal to a mathematical integer. If two

== Other function properties of the Math object ==

<P> Every function listed in this section applies the ''toAnyNumber''
function to each of its arguments (in left-to-right order if there is
more than one) and then performs a computation on the resulting number
value(s) by invoking the corresponding intrinsic method.
