<P> ECMAScript provides a primitive truth value representation in the
class ''boolean''.  It is primitive in the sense that this
representation is directly operated upon by the operators of the
language, and in the sense that the class ''boolean'' is a final and
non-dynamic class for which ECMAScript implementations may provide
efficient representations.

<P> ECMAScript also provides the class ''Boolean'', which is a dynamic
non-final class that holds ''boolean'' values.  

<NOTE> Instances of ''Boolean'' are not normally converted to
''boolean'' when operated upon by operators of the language.


<H2 id="type AnyBoolean"> The type ''AnyBoolean'' </h2>

<P> The type ''AnyBoolean'' is a union containing all the built-in
boolean types.  By standard subtyping rules it also includes all
classes that extend ''Boolean''.

<INCLUDE file="Boolean.es" name="__ES4__ type AnyBoolean">


<H1 id="class Boolean"> The class ''Boolean'' </h1>

<P> The class ''Boolean'' is a dynamic, nullable, non-final subclass
of ''Object'' that holds a boolean value in the form of a ''boolean''
object.  Instances of ''Boolean'' are converted to ''boolean'' when
operated upon by operators of the language.

<P> The class ''Boolean'' can be extended and the extending classes
can provide novel representations for boolean values.


== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Boolean'' provides the following interface:

{{{
dynamic class Boolean
{
    <SIGNATURE file="Boolean.es" name="function Boolean">
    <SIGNATURE file="Boolean.es" name="static meta function invoke">

    static const length: uint = 1

    <SIGNATURE file="Boolean.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">
    <SIGNATURE file="Boolean.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">
}
}}}

<P> The ''Boolean'' prototype object provides the following direct properties:

{{{
    toString: function (this: Booleans) <LDOTS>
    valueOf:  function (this: Booleans) <LDOTS>
}}}

<P> The ''Boolean'' prototype object is also the prototype object of
the class ''boolean''.

== Methods on the ''Boolean'' class object ==

=== new Boolean ( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''Boolean'' constructor intializes a new ''Boolean'' object
by storing //value//, converted to ''boolean'', in a private property.
The default //value// is **false**.

<IMPL> The ''Boolean'' constructor is implementation-defined.

=== Boolean( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''Boolean'' class object called as a function converts
//value// to ''boolean'' (not ''Boolean'').

<RETN> The ''boolean'' class object called as a function returns a
''boolean'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Boolean.es" name="static meta function invoke">

== Methods on ''Boolean'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts this boolean value
to a string.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toString'' method returns a string.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Boolean.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

=== intrinsic::valueOf ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns this boolean value.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns a ''boolean'' object
(not a ''Boolean'' object).

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Boolean.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">

== Methods on the ''Boolean'' prototype object ==

<DESC> The methods on the ''Boolean'' prototype object invoke their
intrinsic counterparts.

<RETN> The methods on the ''Boolean'' prototype object return what their
intrinsic counterparts return.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Boolean.es" name="prototype function toString">
<INCLUDE file="Boolean.es" name="prototype function valueOf">


<H1 id="class boolean"> The class ''boolean'' </h1>

<P> The class ''boolean'' is a non-dynamic, non-nullable, final
subclass of ''Object''.  It represents a boolean value (**true** or
**false**).

<COMP> The class ''boolean'' is new in the 4th Edition of this
Standard, but ''boolean'' models the "boolean values" in the 3rd
Edition.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''boolean'' provides the following interface:

{{{
final class boolean!
{
    <SIGNATURE file="boolean_primitive.es" name="function boolean">
    <SIGNATURE file="boolean_primitive.es" name="static meta function invoke">

    static const length: uint = 1

    <SIGNATURE file="boolean_primitive.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">
    <SIGNATURE file="boolean_primitive.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">
}
}}}

<P> The ''boolean'' prototype object is the same as the ''Boolean''
prototype object (<XREF target="Boolean.prototype">).


== Methods on the ''boolean'' class object ==

=== new boolean ( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''boolean'' constructor intializes a new ''boolean'' object
by storing an implementation-dependent representation of the truth
value of //value//, as computed by ''ToBoolean'' (see <XREF target="ToBoolean">), in a private
property.  The default //value// is **false**.

<IMPL> The ''boolean'' constructor is implementation-defined.

=== boolean( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''boolean'' class object called as a function converts
//value// to ''boolean''.

<RETN> The ''boolean'' class object called as a function returns a
''boolean'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="boolean_primitive.es" name="static meta function invoke">

== Methods on ''boolean'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts this boolean value
to a string, either ''"true"'' or ''"false"''.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toString'' method returns the string.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="boolean_primitive.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

=== intrinsic::valueOf ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns a ''boolean'' instance:
the object on which the method was invoked.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns its ''this'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="boolean_primitive.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">
