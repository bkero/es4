= The class ''string'' =

<P> The ''string'' class (lower case "s") is a final and non-dynamic
subclass of the ''String'' class (upper case "S") and corresponds to
primitive string values in 3rd Edition.

<RATIONALE> The ''string'' class, being final and non-dynamic, can
typically be manipulated more efficiently by the language
implementation than the ''String'' class, which exists primarily for
backwards compatibility with 3rd Edition.

<P> The ''string'' class inherits all the intrinsic methods from the
''String'' class.  Those intrinsic methods invariably forward calls to
their static counterparts in ''string''.

<P> The ''string'' class has the same prototype object as the
''String'' class; changes made to the prototype object of one class
are visible on the prototype object of the other class.

<RATIONALE> The shared prototype aids backward compatibility: in 3rd
Edition, code could effect the ''String'' prototype object by
expressions like ''"mystring".prototype.x=10''.  With the shared
prototype, that code will still work in 4th Edition.

== Static Methods on the ''string'' Class ==

<FIXME> Should ''string'' methods be generic (ie unconstrained in
their object argument), or only ''String'' methods?  The prototype
methods on ''string'' have to be generic, for sure, but the static
methods are new and we can choose.

=== charAt (pos) ===

<P>Returns a string containing the character at position pos in the string resulting from converting this
object to a string. If there is no character at that position, the result is the empty string. The result is a
string value, not a String object.

<P>If pos is a value of Number type that is an integer, then the result of x.charAt(pos) is equal to the
result of x.substring(pos, pos+1).

<P>When the charAt method is called with one argument pos, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function charAt">

<NOTE>
The charAt function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String
object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== charCodeAt (pos) ===

<P>Returns a number (a nonnegative integer less than 216) representing the code point value of the
character at position pos in the string resulting from converting this object to a string. If there is no
character at that position, the result is NaN.

<P>When the charCodeAt method is called with one argument pos, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function charCodeAt">

<NOTE>
The charCodeAt function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String
object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== concat ( ...strings ) ===

<P>When the concat method is called with zero or more arguments string1, string2, etc., it returns a
string consisting of the characters of this object (converted to a string) followed by the characters of
each of string1, string2, etc. (where each argument is converted to a string). The result is a string
value, not a String object. The following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function concat">

<NOTE>
The concat function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String
object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== indexOf (searchString, position) ===

<P>If searchString appears as a substring of the result of converting this object to a string, at one or more
positions that are greater than or equal to position, then the index of the smallest such position is
returned; otherwise, -1 is returned. If position is undefined, 0 is assumed, so as to search all of the
string.

<P>The indexOf method takes two arguments, searchString and position, and performs the following
steps:

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function indexOf">

<NOTE>
The indexOf function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String
object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== lastIndexOf (searchString, position) ===

<P>If searchString appears as a substring of the result of converting this object to a string at one or more
positions that are smaller than or equal to position, then the index of the greatest such position is
returned; otherwise, -1 is returned. If position is undefined, the length of the string value is assumed,
so as to search all of the string.

<P>The lastIndexOf method takes two arguments, searchString and position, and performs the
following steps:

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function indexOf">

<NOTE>The lastIndexOf function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a
String object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== localeCompare (that) ===

<P>When the localeCompare method is called with one argument that, it returns a number other than
NaN that represents the result of a locale-sensitive string comparison of this object (converted to a
string) with that (converted to a string). The two strings are compared in an implementation-defined
fashion. The result is intended to order strings in the sort order specified by the system default locale,
and will be negative, zero, or positive, depending on whether this comes before that in the sort order,
the strings are equal, or this comes after that in the sort order, respectively.

<P>The localeCompare method, if considered as a function of two arguments this and that, is a
consistent comparison function (as defined in 15.4.4.11) on the set of all strings. Furthermore,
localeCompare returns 0 or -0 when comparing two strings that are considered canonically
equivalent by the Unicode standard.

<P>The actual return values are left implementation-defined to permit implementers to encode additional
information in the result value, but the function is required to define a total ordering on all strings and
to return 0 when comparing two strings that are considered canonically equivalent by the Unicode
standard.

<NOTE>
The localeCompare method itself is not directly suitable as an argument to
Array.prototype.sort because the latter requires a function of two arguments.

<NOTE>
This function is intended to rely on whatever language-sensitive comparison functionality is available
to the ECMAScript environment from the host environment, and to compare according to the rules of
the host environment's current locale. It is strongly recommended that this function treat strings that
are canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical (in other words, compare
the strings as if they had both been converted to Normalised Form C or D first). It is also
recommended that this function not honour Unicode compatibility equivalences or decompositions.
If no language-sensitive comparison at all is available from the host environment, this function may
perform a bitwise comparison.

<NOTE>
The localeCompare function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a
String object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

<NOTE>
The second parameter to this function is likely to be used in a future version of this standard; it is
recommended that implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.

=== match (regexp) ===

<P>If regexp is not an object whose [[Class]] property is "RegExp", it is replaced with the result of the
expression new RegExp(regexp). Let string denote the result of converting the this value to a
string. Then do one of the following:
<OL>
<LI> If regexp.global is false: Return the result obtained by invoking RegExp.prototype.exec
(see 15.10.6.2) on regexp with string as parameter.
<LI> If regexp.global is true: Set the regexp.lastIndex property to 0 and invoke
RegExp.prototype.exec repeatedly until there is no match. If there is a match with an empty
string (in other words, if the value of regexp.lastIndex is left unchanged), increment
regexp.lastIndex by 1. Let n be the number of matches. The value returned is an array with the
length property set to n and properties 0 through n-1 corresponding to the first elements of the
results of all matching invocations of RegExp.prototype.exec.
</OL>

<NOTE>
The match function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String object.
Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== replace (searchValue, replaceValue) ===

<P>Let string denote the result of converting the this value to a string.
If searchValue is a regular expression (an object whose [[Class]] property is "RegExp"), do the
following: If searchValue.global is false, then search string for the first match of the regular
expression searchValue. If searchValue.global is true, then search string for all matches of the
regular expression searchValue. Do the search in the same manner as in
String.prototype.match, including the update of searchValue.lastIndex. Let m be the
number of left capturing parentheses in searchValue (NCapturingParens as specified in 15.10.2.1).
If searchValue is not a regular expression, let searchString be ToString(searchValue) and search
string for the first occurrence of searchString. Let m be 0.
If replaceValue is a function, then for each matched substring, call the function with the following m
+ 3 arguments. Argument 1 is the substring that matched. If searchValue is a regular expression, the
next m arguments are all of the captures in the MatchResult (see 15.10.2.1). Argument m + 2 is the
offset within string where the match occurred, and argument m + 3 is string. The result is a string
value derived from the original input by replacing each matched substring with the corresponding
return value of the function call, converted to a string if need be.
Otherwise, let newstring denote the result of converting replaceValue to a string. The result is a string
value derived from the original input string by replacing each matched substring with a string derived
from newstring by replacing characters in newstring by replacement text as specified in the following
table. These $ replacements are done left-to-right, and, once such a replacement is performed, the new
replacement text is not subject to further replacements. For example,
"$1,$2".replace(/(\$(\d))/g, "$$1-$1$2") returns "$1-$11,$1-$22". A $ in
newstring that does not match any of the forms below is left as is.

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Characters</th><th>Replacement text</th></tr>
<tr><td>$$</td>        <td>$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$&</td>        <td>The matched substring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$`</td>        <td>The portion of string that precedes the matched substring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$'</td>        <td>The portion of string that follows the matched substring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$n</td>        <td>The //n//th capture, where //n// is a single digit 1-9 and ''$n'' is not
                           followed by a decimal digit. If //n<LEQ>m// and the //n//th capture
                           is undefined, use the empty string instead. If //n<GT>m//,
                           the result is implementation-defined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$nn</td>       <td>The //nn//th capture, where //nn// is a two-digit decimal number
                           01-99. If //nn<LEQ>m// and the //nn//th capture is undefined, use
                           the empty string instead. If //nn<GT>m//, the result is implementation-defined.</td></tr>
</table>

<NOTE>
The replace function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String
object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== search (regexp) ===

<P>If regexp is not an object whose [[Class]] property is "RegExp", it is replaced with the result of the
expression new RegExp(regexp). Let string denote the result of converting the this value to a
string.

<P>The value string is searched from its beginning for an occurrence of the regular expression pattern
regexp. The result is a number indicating the offset within the string where the pattern matched, or -1
if there was no match.

<NOTE>
This method ignores the lastIndex and global properties of regexp. The lastIndex property
of regexp is left unchanged.

<NOTE>
The search function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String
object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== slice (start, end) ===

<P>The slice method takes two arguments, start and end, and returns a substring of the result of
converting this object to a string, starting from character position start and running to, but not
including, character position end (or through the end of the string if end is undefined). If start is
negative, it is treated as (sourceLength+start) where sourceLength is the length of the string. If end is
negative, it is treated as (sourceLength+end) where sourceLength is the length of the string. The result
is a string value, not a String object. The following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function slice">

<NOTE>
The slice function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String object.
Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== split (separator, limit) ===

<P>Returns an Array object into which substrings of the result of converting this object to a string have
been stored. The substrings are determined by searching from left to right for occurrences of
separator; these occurrences are not part of any substring in the returned array, but serve to divide up
the string value. The value of separator may be a string of any length or it may be a RegExp object
(i.e., an object whose [[Class]] property is "RegExp"; see 15.10).

<P>The value of separator may be an empty string, an empty regular expression, or a regular expression
that can match an empty string. In this case, separator does not match the empty substring at the
beginning or end of the input string, nor does it match the empty substring at the end of the previous
separator match. (For example, if separator is the empty string, the string is split up into individual
characters; the length of the result array equals the length of the string, and each substring contains
one character.) If separator is a regular expression, only the first match at a given position of the this
string is considered, even if backtracking could yield a non-empty-substring match at that position.
(For example, "ab".split(/a*?/) evaluates to the array ["a","b"], while
"ab".split(/a*/) evaluates to the array["","b"].)

<P>If the this object is (or converts to) the empty string, the result depends on whether separator can
match the empty string. If it can, the result array contains no elements. Otherwise, the result array
contains one element, which is the empty string.

<P>If separator is a regular expression that contains capturing parentheses, then each time separator is
matched the results (including any undefined results) of the capturing parentheses are spliced into the
output array. For example,
{{{
"A<B>bold</B>and<CODE>coded</CODE>".split(/<(\/)?([^<>]+)>/)
}}}
evaluates to the array
{{{
["A", undefined, "B", "bold", "/", "B", "and", undefined, "CODE", "coded", "/", "CODE", ""].
}}}

<P>If separator is undefined, then the result array contains just one string, which is the this value
(converted to a string). If limit is not undefined, then the output array is truncated so that it contains
no more than limit elements.

<P>When the split method is called, the following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function split">

The internal helper function SplitMatch takes three parameters, a string S, an integer q, and a string or
RegExp R, and performs the following in order to return a MatchResult (see 15.10.2.1):


<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function splitMatch">

<NOTE>
The split function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String object.
Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

<NOTE>
The split method ignores the value of separator.global for separators that are RegExp objects.

=== substring (start, end) ===

<P>The substring method takes two arguments, start and end, and returns a substring of the result of
converting this object to a string, starting from character position start and running to, but not
including, character position end of the string (or through the end of the string is end is undefined).

<P>The result is a string value, not a String object.

<P>If either argument is NaN or negative, it is replaced with zero; if either argument is larger than the
length of the string, it is replaced with the length of the string.

<P>If start is larger than end, they are swapped.

<P>The following steps are taken:

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function substring">

<NOTE>
The substring function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a String
object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== toLowerCase ( ) ===

<P>If this object is not already a string, it is converted to a string. The characters in that string are
converted one by one to lower case. The result is a string value, not a String object.
The characters are converted one by one. The result of each conversion is the original character,
unless that character has a Unicode lowercase equivalent, in which case the lowercase equivalent is
used instead.

<NOTE>
The result should be derived according to the case mappings in the Unicode character database (this
explicitly includes not only the UnicodeData.txt file, but also the SpecialCasings.txt file that
accompanies it in Unicode 2.1.8 and later).

<NOTE>
The toLowerCase function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a
String object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== toLocaleLowerCase ( ) ===

<P>This function works exactly the same as toLowerCase except that its result is intended to yield the
correct result for the host environment's current locale, rather than a locale-independent result. There
will only be a difference in the few cases (such as Turkish) where the rules for that language conflict
with the regular Unicode case mappings.

<NOTE>
The toLocaleLowerCase function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value
be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

<NOTE>
The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a future version of this standard; it is
recommended that implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.

=== toUpperCase ( ) ===

<P>This function behaves in exactly the same way as String.prototype.toLowerCase, except
that characters are mapped to their uppercase equivalents as specified in the Unicode Character
Database.

<NOTE>
Because both toUpperCase and toLowerCase have context-sensitive behaviour, the functions
are not symmetrical. In other words, s.toUpperCase().toLowerCase() is not necessarily
equal to s.toLowerCase().

<NOTE>
The toUpperCase function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value be a
String object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

=== toLocaleUpperCase ( ) ===

<P>This function works exactly the same as toUpperCase except that its result is intended to yield the
correct result for the host environment's current locale, rather than a locale-independent result. There
will only be a difference in the few cases (such as Turkish) where the rules for that language conflict
with the regular Unicode case mappings.

<NOTE>
The toLocaleUpperCase function is intentionally generic; it does not require that its this value
be a String object. Therefore, it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

<NOTE>
The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a future version of this standard; it is
recommended that implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.
