<P> The class ''string'' is a final, non-nullable, non-dynamic
subclass of Object that represents an immutable indexable sequence of
Unicode characters.  The property ''"length"'' holds the number of
characters in this sequence.  The property ''"0"'' names the first
character, the property ''"1"'' names the second character, and so on,
up to property ''"length"''-1.  Single characters are represented as
''string'' objects with length equal to one.

<P> The ''string'' class has the same prototype object as the
''String'' class; changes made to the prototype object of one class
are visible on the prototype object of the other class.

<COMP> The class ''string'' is new in the 4th Edition of this
Standard, but ''string'' models the "string values" in the 3rd
Edition.


== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''string'' provides the following interface:

== Static Methods on the ''string'' Class ==

=== new string ( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''string'' constructor initializes a new ''string'' object
by storing an implementation-dependent string representation of
//value// in a private property.  The default //value// is the empty
string.

<IMPL> The ''string'' constructor is implementation-dependent.

=== string ( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''string'' class object called as a function converts
//value// to ''string'' as by the ''ToString'' operator.  The default
//value// is the empty string.

<RETN> The ''string'' class object called as a function returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static meta function invoke">

<FIXME> (Ticket #176.) The use of ''magic::newString'' is an
optimization that confuses the spec; ''new string(x)'' would have been
better.

=== fromCharCode ( ...codes ) ===

<DESC> The static ''fromCharCode'' method creates a ''string''
containing as many characters as there are elements in //codes//.
Each element of //codes// specifies the Unicode code point value of
one character of the resulting string, with the first argument
specifying the first character, and so on, from left to right.

<FIXME> (Ticket #170.) The code below assumes a 21-bit Unicode
representation.  What happens in a system that only has 16-bit
unicode?  We'd like to be backwards compatible.  If so, the upper bits
are ignored.  This conflicts with how ''\u{...}'' is handled, though:
it creates two code points.

<RETN> The static ''fromCharCode'' method returns the computed ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function fromCharCode">
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="helper static function fromCharCode">

=== charAt (self, pos) ===

<DESC> The static ''charAt'' method converts //self// to ''string'' and
extracts the character at index //pos//.

<RETN> The static ''charAt'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function charAt">

<FIXME> (Ticket #176.) The use of ''magic::charCodeAt'' is an optimization that
complicates the spec; ''string.charCodeAt(x)'' would have been better.

=== charCodeAt (self, pos) ===

<DESC> The static ''charCodeAt'' method converts //self// to ''string'' and
extracts the code point value of the character at index //pos//.

<RETN> The static ''charCodeAt'' method returns a number.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function charCodeAt">

=== concat ( self, ...strings ) ===

<DESC> The static ''concat'' method computes a ''string'' value
consisting of the characters of //self// (converted to ''string'')
followed by the characters of each of the elements of //strings//
(where each argument is converted to ''string'').

<RETN> The static ''concat'' method returns the concatenated ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function concat">
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="helper static function concat">

=== indexOf ( self, searchString, position) ===

<DESC> The static ''indexOf'' method searches //self// (converted to
string) for occurrences of //searchString// (converted to ''string''),
at positions that are greater than or equal to //position// (converted
to integer).

<RETN> The static ''indexOf'' method returns the smallest index at
which a match was found, or -1 if there was no match.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function indexOf">

<FIXME> (Ticket #176.) The use of ''magic::charCodeAt'' is an optimization that
complicates the spec; using ''string.charCodeAt'' would have been
better.

=== lastIndexOf ( self, searchString, position) ===

<DESC> The static ''lastIndexOf'' method searches //self// (converted
to string) for occurrences of //searchString// (converted to
''string''), at positions that are smaller than or equal to
//position// (converted to integer).

<RETN> The static ''lastIndexOf'' method returns the greatest index at
which a match was found, or -1 if there was no match.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function indexOf">

<FIXME> (Ticket #176.) The use of ''magic::charCodeAt'' is an optimization that
complicates the spec; using ''string.charCodeAt'' would have been
better.

=== localeCompare (self, other) ===

<DESC> The static ''localeCompare'' method compares //self//
(converted to ''string'') with //other// (converted to string) in a
locale-sensitive manner.  The two strings are compared in an
implementation-defined fashion.  The comparison is intended to order
strings in the sort order specified by the system default locale.

<RETN> The static ''localeCompare'' method returns a number other than
**NaN** that represents the result of the comparison.  The result will
be negative, zero, or positive, depending on whether //self// comes
before //other// in the sort order, the strings are equal, or //self//
comes after //other// in the sort order, respectively.

<P>The static ''localeCompare'' method is a consistent comparison
function (as defined in <XREF target="sort:consistent_comparator">) on
the set of all strings.  Furthermore, ''localeCompare'' returns 0 or -0
when comparing two strings that are considered canonically equivalent
by the Unicode standard.

<P>The actual return values are left implementation-defined to permit
implementers to encode additional information in the result value, but
the function is required to define a total ordering on all strings and
to return 0 when comparing two strings that are considered canonically
equivalent by the Unicode standard.

<IMPL> The static ''localeCompare'' method is implementation-defined.

<NOTE> This function is intended to rely on whatever
language-sensitive comparison functionality is available to the
ECMAScript environment from the host environment, and to compare
according to the rules of the host environment's current locale. It is
strongly recommended that this function treat strings that are
canonically equivalent according to the Unicode standard as identical
(in other words, compare the strings as if they had both been
converted to Normalised Form C or D first). It is also recommended
that this function not honour Unicode compatibility equivalences or
decompositions.  If no language-sensitive comparison at all is
available from the host environment, this function may perform a
bitwise comparison.

<NOTE> The third parameter to this function is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that
implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.


=== match (self, regexp) ===

<DESC> The static ''match'' method searches //self// (converted to
''string'') for occurrences of //regexp// (converted to ''RegExp'').

<RETN> If the ''global'' flag on //regexp// is **false**, the ''match'' method returns
the result obtained by invoking the intrinsic ''exec'' method on //regexp// with //self//
as a parameter.

<P> If the ''global'' flag on //regexp// is **true**, the ''match''
method returns an array of strings containing the substrings of
//self// that were matched by //regexp//, in order.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function match">

=== replace (self, searchValue, replaceValue) ===

<DESC> The static ''replace'' method computes a string from //self//
(converted to ''string'') by replacing substrings matching
//searchValue// (converted to ''string'' if not ''RegExp'') by
instances of //replaceValue// (converted to ''string'' if not a
function).

<P> If //replaceValue// is a function, then it is called once for each
matched substring on arguments providing details about the match, and
the value returned from this call is converted to ''string'' if
necessary and replaces the matched substring.

<P> If //replaceValue// is not a function then a string to replace a
matched substring is derived from //replaceValue// by replacing
characters of //replaceValue// (converted to ''string'') as specified
in the following table.  These ''$'' replacements are done
left-to-right, and, once such a replacement is performed, the new
replacement text is not subject to further replacements.  For example,
''"$1,$2".replace(/(\$(\d))/g, "$$1-$1$2")'' returns
''"$1-$11,$1-$22"''.  A ''$'' in //replaceValue// that does not match
any of the forms below is left as is.

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Characters</th><th>Replacement text</th></tr>
<tr><td>$$</td>        <td>$</td></tr>
<tr><td>$&</td>        <td>The matched substring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$`</td>        <td>The portion of //self// that precedes the matched substring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$'</td>        <td>The portion of //self// that follows the matched substring.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$n</td>        <td>The //n//th capture, where //n// is a single digit 1-9 and ''$n'' is not
                           followed by a decimal digit. If //n<LEQ>m// and the //n//th capture
                           is undefined, use the empty string instead. If //n<GT>m//,
                           the result is implementation-defined.</td></tr>
<tr><td>$nn</td>       <td>The //nn//th capture, where //nn// is a two-digit decimal number
                           01-99. If //nn<LEQ>m// and the //nn//th capture is undefined, use
                           the empty string instead. If //nn<GT>m//, the result is implementation-defined.</td></tr>
</table>

<NOTE> In the above table, //m// is the length of the search result's
capture array.

<RETN> The static ''replace'' function returns a ''string'' object
that is the concatenation of the unmatched portions of //self// and
the computed replace values for the matched portions of //self//, in
order.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function replace">

<FIXME> (Ticket #177.) The code above needs to be factored into a
top-level function with the auxiliary functions following it; values
of names now free in the nested functions must be passed as
parameters.

=== search (self, regexp) ===

<DESC> The static ''search'' method searches //self// (converted to
''string'') for the first occurrence of the search term //regexp//
(converted to ''RegExp'').

<NOTE> This method ignores the ''lastIndex'' and global properties of
//regexp//.  The ''lastIndex'' property of //regexp// is left
unchanged.

<RETN> The static ''search'' method returns a number indicating the index
at which a match was made, or -1 if there was no match.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function search">

=== slice (self, start, end) ===

<DESC> The static ''slice'' method extracts a substring of //self//
(converted to ''string'') from //start// and up to but not including
//end// (both converted to integer).  Both //start// and //end// may
be negative.

<RETN> The static ''slice'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function slice">

=== split (self, separator, limit) ===

<DESC> The static ''split'' method extracts substrings from //self//
(converted to ''string''), where substrings are separated by instances
of //separator// (converted to ''string'' if not a ''RegExp'').  At
most //limit// substrings are extracted.

<P> Occurrences of //separator// are not part of any substring in the result.

<P>The value of //separator// may be an empty string, an empty regular
expression, or a regular expression that can match an empty string.
In this case, //separator// does not match the empty substring at the
beginning or end of the input string, nor does it match the empty
substring at the end of the previous separator match.  (For example,
if //separator// is the empty string, the string is split up into
individual characters; the length of the result array equals the
length of the string, and each substring contains one character.)  If
//separator// is a regular expression, only the first match at a given
position of the ''this'' string is considered, even if backtracking could
yield a non-empty-substring match at that position.  (For example,
''string.split("ab",/a*?/)'' evaluates to the array ''["a","b"]'',
while ''string.split("ab",/a*/)'' evaluates to the array
''[%%""%%,"b"]''.)

<P> If //self// is (or converts to) the empty string, the result
depends on whether //separator// can match the empty string.  If it
can, the result contains no elements.  Otherwise, the result contains
one element, which is the empty string.

<P> If //separator// is a regular expression that contains capturing
parentheses, then each time //separator// is matched the results
(including any undefined results) of the capturing parentheses are
spliced into the result. For example,
{{{
"A<B>bold</B>and<CODE>coded</CODE>".split(/<(\/)?([^<>]+)>/)
}}}
evaluates to the array
{{{
["A", undefined, "B", "bold", "/", "B", "and", undefined, "CODE", "coded", "/", "CODE", ""].
}}}

<P>If //separator// is **undefined**, then the result contains just one
string, which is //self// (converted to ''string'').

<RETN> The static ''split'' method returns a new ''Array'' object
holding the extracted substrings, in order.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function split">

<FIXME> (Ticket #178.) The exposition leaves something to be desired.
Should split ''splitMatch'' out as a separate helper function, at
least.

<NOTE> The static ''split'' method ignores the value of
//separator//''.global'' for separators that are ''RegExp'' objects.

=== substring (self, start, end) ===

<DESC> The static ''substring'' method extracts a substring from
//self// (converted to ''string'') from //start// up to but not
including //end// (converted to number).

<RETN> The static ''substring'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function substring">

=== toLowerCase ( self ) ===

<DESC> The static ''toLowerCase'' method converts the characters of
//self// (converted to string) to lower case.  The characters are
converted one by one.  The result of each conversion is the original
character, unless that character has a Unicode lowercase equivalent,
in which case the lowercase equivalent is used instead.

<NOTE> The result should be derived according to the case mappings in
the Unicode character database (this explicitly includes not only the
''UnicodeData.txt'' file, but also the ''SpecialCasings.txt'' file
that accompanies it in Unicode 2.1.8 and later).

<RETN> The static ''toLowerCase'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function toLowerCase">

<FIXME> (Ticket #176.) The use of ''magic::charCodeAt'' and
''magic::fromCharCode'' is a confusing optimization.

<FIXME> (Ticket #179.) Cross reference to the Unicode library somehow,
or put the unicode stuff into the ''helper'' namespace.

=== toLocaleLowerCase ( self ) ===

<DESC> The static ''toLocaleLowerCase'' method works exactly the same
as the static ''toLowerCase'' method except that it is intended to
yield the correct result for the host environment's current locale,
rather than a locale-independent result.  There will only be a
difference in the few cases (such as Turkish) where the rules for that
language conflict with the regular Unicode case mappings.

<RETN> The static ''toLocaleLowerCase'' method returns a ''string''.

<IMPL>
The static ''toLocaleLowerCase'' method is implementation-dependent.

<NOTE> The second parameter to this function is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that
implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.

=== toUpperCase ( self ) ===

<DESC> The static ''toUpperCase'' method converts the characters of
//self// (converted to string) to upper case.  The characters are
converted one by one.  The result of each conversion is the original
character, unless that character has a Unicode uppercase equivalent,
in which case the uppercase equivalent is used instead.

<NOTE> The result should be derived according to the case mappings in
the Unicode character database (this explicitly includes not only the
''UnicodeData.txt'' file, but also the ''SpecialCasings.txt'' file
that accompanies it in Unicode 2.1.8 and later).

<RETN> The static ''toUpperCase'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function toUpperCase">

<NOTE> Because both ''toUpperCase'' and ''toLowerCase'' have
context-sensitive behaviour, the functions are not symmetrical. In
other words, ''string.toLowerCase(string.toUpperCase(s))'' is not
necessarily equal to ''string.toLowerCase(s)''.


=== toLocaleUpperCase ( self ) ===

<DESC> The static ''toLocaleUpperCase'' method works exactly the same
as the static ''toUpperCase'' method except that it is intended to
yield the correct result for the host environment's current locale,
rather than a locale-independent result.  There will only be a
difference in the few cases (such as Turkish) where the rules for that
language conflict with the regular Unicode case mappings.

<RETN> The static ''toLocaleUpperCase'' method returns a ''string''.

<IMPL>
The static ''toLocaleUpperCase'' method is implementation-dependent.

<NOTE> The second parameter to this function is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that
implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.

=== trim ( self ) ===

<DESC> The static ''trim'' method extracts a substring from //self//
(converted to ''string'') such that the extracted string contains no
whitespace characters at either end.

<RETN> The static ''trim'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="static function trim">

<FIXME> (Ticket #179.) Reference to Unicode library -- handle this somehow.

== Methods on ''string'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString ===

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toString'' method returns this string value: the object itself.

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

=== intrinsic::valueOf ===

<RETN> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns this string value: the object itself.

<INCLUDE file="string_primitive.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">

=== Methods that delegate to static methods ===

<DESC> The intrinsic methods ''charAt'', ''charCodeAt'', ''concat'',
''indexOf'', ''lastIndexOf'', ''localeCompare'', ''match'',
''replace'', ''search'', ''slice'', ''split'',
''substring'', ''toLowerCase'', ''toLocaleLowerCase'',
''toUpperCase'', ''toLocaleUpperCase'', and ''trim'' all delegate to
the corresponding static methods on the ''string'' class.

<RETN> These intrinsic methods return what their corresponding static
methods on the ''string'' class return.
