CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 3 (2008-03-17)

  * "static public" => "public static"


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 2 (2008-03-10)

  * Name is now a subclass of 'Object' (not of 'String')

  * The 'valueOf' method has been removed; 'Name' inherits the method
    from the class 'Object'

  * The constructor interface spec has been broken up into one and two
    argument cases, for the sake of clarity.


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 1 (2008-03-05)

  * Compatibility note in intro.

  * More elaborate status block above.

  * Prototype and intrinsic methods forward to private methods now.

  * The Name constructor is allowed to hash-cons.

  * The Name converter is required to return its first argument if it
    is a Name object and the second parameter is undefined.


NOTES

  * Due to an RI bug (#368), the namespace 'Private' is used instead
    of 'private'.

[2] builtins/Name.es in the ES4 RI
</pre>
<HR>

<P> The class ''Name'' is a final, nullable, non-dynamic, direct
subclass of ''Object'' that reflects a property name as a pair of
''Namespace'' and ''string'' values.

<COMP> The ''Namespace'' class is new in the 4th Edition of this Standard.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Name'' provides the following interface:

{{{
__ES4__ final class Name extends Object
{
    public function Name(...args) <LDOTS>
    static meta function invoke(...args): Name <LDOTS>
    
    static public const length = 2

    <SIGNATURE file="Name.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

    public const qualifier:  Namespace
    public const identifier: string
}
}}}

<P> The ''Name'' prototype object provides the following direct properties:

{{{
    toString: function (this: Name) <LDOTS>
}}}

== Operators ==

<P> The operators ''=='' and ''==='' compare as equal two ''Name''
objects that are separately created from the same
(qualifier,identifier) pair; similarly, the operators ''!='' and
''!=='' compare as not equal two ''Name'' objects that are separately
created from (qualifier,identifier) pairs.


== Methods on the ''Name'' class object ==

=== new Name ( id ) ===

<RETN> When the ''Name'' constructor is called with one argument
//id// it returns a ''Name'' object whose ''qualifier'' is null
and whose ''identifier'' is //id// converted to ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
public function Name( id ) <LDOTS>
}}}

=== new Name( ns, id ) ===

<RETN> When the ''Name'' constructor is called with two arguments
//ns// and //id// it returns a ''Name'' object whose ''qualifier'' is
//ns// and whose ''identifier'' is //id// converted to ''string''.

<P> //ns// may be **null**.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
public function Name( ns: Namespace?, id ) <LDOTS>
}}}

=== Name ( ...args ) ===

<DESC> The ''Name'' class object called as a function creates a
''Name'' object by invoking the ''Name'' constructor on its
argumen(s)

<RETN> The ''Name'' class object called as a function returns a
''Name'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
static meta function invoke( ...args )
    new Name(...args);
}}}

== Methods on ''Name'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts this ''Name'' object
to a string.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toString'' method returns a string.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Name.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">
<INCLUDE file="Name.es" name="Private function toString">


== Value properties of ''Name'' instances ==

=== qualifier ===

<P> The ''qualifier'' property holds the namespace value for this
''Name'' object.  If ''qualifier'' is null then the implied namespace
is the compatibility namespace **noNS**.

=== identifier ===

<P> The ''identifier'' property holds the identifier value for this
''Name'' object.  It is never null.


== Methods on the ''Name'' prototype object ==

<DESC> The methods on the ''Name'' prototype object perform the same
operations as their corresponding intrinsic methods perform.

<RETN> The methods on the ''Name'' prototype object return what their
corresponding intrinsic methods return.

<SHORTIMPL>
