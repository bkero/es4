<p>There are certain built-in objects available whenever an ECMAScript
program begins execution. One, the global object, is in the scope
chain of the executing program. Others are accessible as initial
properties of the global object.

<p>Unless specified otherwise, the [[Class]] property of a built-in
object is ''"Function"'' if that built-in object has a [[Call]]
property, or ''"Object"'' if that built-in object does not have a
[[Call]] property.

<p>Many built-in objects are functions: they can be invoked with
arguments. Some of them furthermore are constructors: they are
functions intended for use with the ''new'' operator. For each
built-in function, this specification describes the arguments required
by that function and properties of the Function object. For each
built-in constructor, this specification furthermore describes
properties of the prototype object of that constructor and properties
of specific object instances returned by a ''new'' expression that
invokes that constructor.

<p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular
function, if a function or constructor described in this section is
given fewer arguments than the function is specified to require, the
function or constructor shall behave exactly as if it had been given
sufficient additional arguments, each such argument being the
''undefined'' value.

<p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular
function, if a function or constructor described in this section is
given more arguments than the function is specified to allow, the
behaviour of the function or constructor is undefined. In particular,
an implementation is permitted (but not required) to throw a
''TypeError'' exception in this case.

<p class="NOTE">NOTE<br> Implementations that add additional
capabilities to the set of built-in functions are encouraged to do so
by adding new functions rather than adding new parameters to existing
functions.

<p>Every built-in function and every built-in constructor has the
Function prototype object, which is the initial value of the
expression ''Function.prototype'' (<XREF target="Function.prototype">),
as the value of its internal [[Prototype]] property.

<p>Every built-in prototype object has the Object prototype object,
which is the initial value of the expression ''Object.prototype''
(<XREF target="Object.prototype">), as the value of its internal
[[Prototype]] property, except the Object prototype object itself.

<p>None of the built-in functions described in this section shall
implement the internal [[Construct]] method unless otherwise specified
in the description of a particular function. None of the built-in
functions described in this section shall initially have a
''prototype'' property unless otherwise specified in the description
of a particular function. Every built-in Function object described in
this section--whether as a constructor, an ordinary function, or
both--has a ''length'' property whose value is an integer. Unless
otherwise specified, this value is equal to the largest number of
named arguments shown in the section headings for the function
description, including optional parameters.

<p class="NOTE">NOTE<br> For example, the Function object that is the
initial value of the slice property of the String prototype object is
described under the section heading ''String.prototype.slice (start ,
end)'' which shows the two named arguments start and end; therefore
the value of the length property of that Function object is 2.

<p> In every case, the ''length'' property of a built-in Function
object described in this section has the attributes { ReadOnly,
DontDelete, DontEnum } (and no others). Every other property described
in this section has the attribute { DontEnum } (and no others) unless
otherwise specified.
