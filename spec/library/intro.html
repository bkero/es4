= Introduction =

<p>There are certain built-in objects available whenever an ECMAScript
program begins execution. One, the global object, is in the scope
chain of the executing program. Others are accessible as initial
properties of the global object.

<FIXME>There may be multiple global objects.

<p>Unless specified otherwise, the [[Class]] property of a built-in
object is ''"Class"'' if that object is defined as a class,
''"Function"'' if that built-in object is not a class but has a
[[Call]] property, or ''"Object"'' if that built-in object neither is
a class nor has a [[Call]] property.

<COMP>The 3rd Edition of this Standard did not provide classes, and
all built-in objects provided as classes in 4th Edition were
previously provided as functions.  The change from functions to
classes is observable to programs that convert the built-in class
objects to strings.

<p>Many built-in objects behave like functions: they can be invoked
with arguments.  Some of them furthermore are constructors: they are
classes intended for use with the ''new'' operator. For each built-in
class, this specification describes the arguments required by that
class's constructor and properties of the Class object. For each
built-in class, this specification furthermore describes properties of
the prototype object of that class and properties of specific object
instances returned by a ''new'' expression that constucts instances of
that class.

<p>Built-in classes have four kinds of functions, collectively called
methods: constructors, static methods, prototype methods, and
intrinsic instance methods.  Non-class built-in objects may
additionally hold non-method functions.

<COMP>The 3rd Edition of this standard provided only
constructors and prototype methods.  The new methods are not visible
to 3rd Edition code being executed by a 4th Edition implementation.

<p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular
class, if a constructor, prototype method, or ordinary function described
in this section is given fewer arguments than the function is
specified to require, the function shall behave exactly as if it had
been given sufficient additional arguments, each such argument being
the ''undefined'' value.

<p>Unless otherwise specified in the description of a particular
class, if a constructor, prototype method, or ordinary function described
in this section is given more arguments than the function is specified
to allow, the behaviour of the function is undefined. In particular,
an implementation is permitted (but not required) to throw a
''TypeError'' exception in this case.

<NOTE>Implementations that add additional capabilities to the set of
built-in classes are encouraged to do so by adding new functions and
methods rather than adding new parameters to existing functions and
methods.

<p>Every built-in function has the Function prototype object, which is
the initial value of the expression ''Function.prototype'' (<XREF
target="Function.prototype">), as the value of its internal
[[Prototype]] property.

<p>Every built-in class has the Object prototype object, which is the initial
value of the expression ''Object.prototype'' (<XREF target="Object.prototype">),
as the value of its internal [[Prototype]] property.

<COMP>In the 3rd Edition of this Standard every constructor
function that is represented as a class in 4th Edition also had the
Function prototype object as the value of its internal [[Prototype]]
property.  This change is observable to programs that attempt to call
methods defined on the Function prototype object through a class
object.

<p>Every built-in prototype object has the Object prototype object,
which is the initial value of the expression ''Object.prototype''
(<XREF target="Object.prototype">), as the value of its internal
[[Prototype]] property, except the Object prototype object itself.

<p>None of the built-in functions described in this section shall
implement the internal [[Construct]] method unless otherwise specified
in the description of a particular function. None of the built-in
functions described in this section shall initially have a
''prototype'' property unless otherwise specified in the description
of a particular function. Every built-in Function object described in
this section--whether as a constructor, an ordinary function, or a
method--has a ''length'' property whose value is an integer. Unless
otherwise specified, this value is equal to the largest number of
named arguments shown in the section headings for the function
description, including optional parameters.

<NOTE>For example, the Function object that is the initial
value of the ''slice'' property of the String prototype object is
described under the section heading ''String.prototype.slice (start ,
end)'' which shows the two named arguments start and end; therefore
the value of the length property of that Function object is 2.

<!--
Obsolete:

<p> In every case, the ''length'' property of a built-in Function
object described in this section has the attributes { ReadOnly,
DontDelete, DontEnum } (and no others). Every other property described
in this section has the attribute { DontEnum } (and no others) unless
otherwise specified.
-->

<p>The built-in objects and functions are defined in terms of
ECMAScript packages, namespaces, classes, types, methods, properties,
and functions, with the help from a small number of implementation
hooks.

<NOTE>Though the behavior and structure of built-in objects and
functions is expressed in ECMAScript terms, implementations are not
required to implement them in ECMAScript, only to preserve the
behavior as it is defined in this Standard.

<p>Implementation hooks manifest themselves as functions in the
''magic'' namespace, as in the definition of the intrinsic
''toString'' method on ''Object'' objects:

<INCLUDE file="Object.es" name="intrinsic function toString">

<p>All magic function definitions are collected in section <XREF
target="library-magic">.

<p>The definitions of the built-in objects and functions also leave
some room for the implementation to choose strategies for certain
auxiliary and primitive operations.  These variation points manifest
themselves as functions in the ''informative'' namespace, as in the
definition of the intrinsic function ''nanoAge'' on ''Date'' objects:

<INCLUDE file="Date.es" name="intrinsic function nanoAge">

<p>Informative methods and functions are defined non-operationally in
the sections that makes use of them.

<p>The definitions of the built-in objects and functions also make use
of internal helper functions and properties, written in ECMAScript.
These helper functions and properties are not available to user
programs and are included in this Standard for expository purposes, as
they help to define the semantics of the functions that make use of
them.  Helper functions and properties manifest themselves as
definitions in the ''helper'' namespace, as in the definition of the
global ''encodeURI'' function:

<INCLUDE file="Global.es" name="intrinsic function encodeURI">

<p>Helper functions and properties are defined where they are first
used, but are sometimes referenced from multiple sections in this
Standard.

<FIXME>We need a credible story for helper primitives like
''ToString'' and ''ToNumeric''.  In the current code, they are just
treated like global functions; more appropriate would be if they were
in a namespace like ''helper'' or ''magic''.

<p>Unless noted otherwise in the description of a particular class or
function, the behavior of built-in objects is unaffected by
definitions or assignments performed by the user program.  This is
accomplished first by defining all built-in objects, classes,
functions, and properties inside a package whose name is private to
the implementation, second by always preferring intrinsic methods and
functions to prototype methods and unqualified functions, and finally
by importing the public names of the package containing the built-ins
into the global environment of the user program.

<FIXME>Does this provide us with the correct semantics?  If we do it
as described, a user program can create a new binding for "Object"
that shadows our "Object".  This is not a problem for the built-in; it
may or may not be a benefit to the user program.  It may or may not be
backwards compatible (what happens if the user program contains ''var
isNaN'' -- does this redundantly state that there is a binding for
''isNaN'' or does it create a new binding?)
