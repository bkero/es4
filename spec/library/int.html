<P> The class ''int'' is a final, non-nullable, non-dynamic direct
subclass of ''Object'' that represents two's complement signed 32-bit
integer values in the range -2<sup>31</sup> to 2<sup>31</sup>-1
inclusive.

<COMP> The class ''int'' is new in the 4th Edition of this Standard.

== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''int'' provides the following interface:

{{{
final class int!
{
    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="function int">
    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="meta static function invoke">
    
    static const MAX_VALUE: int = 0x7FFFFFFF
    static const MIN_VALUE: int = -0x80000000
    static const length: uint = 1

    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">
    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="override intrinsic function toLocaleString">
    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">

    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="intrinsic function toFixed">
    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="intrinsic function toExponential">
    <SIGNATURE file="int.es" name="intrinsic function toPrecision">
}
}}}

<P> The ''int'' prototype object is identical to the ''Number''
prototype object (<XREF target="Number.prototype">).

== Methods on the ''int'' class object ==

=== new int( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The ''int'' constructor it initialises the newly created
''int'' object by storing an implementation-defined representation of
the integer value of //value//, as computed by the ''ToInt32''
operator, in a private property.  The default //value// is 0.

<IMPL> The ''int'' constructor is implementation-defined.

=== int( value=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> When the ''int'' class object is called as a function it
performs a type conversion: it converts //value// (which defaults
to 0) to ''int''.

<RETN> The ''int'' class object called as a function returns an
''int''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="int.es" name="meta static function invoke">

<FIXME> (Ticket #176.)  It would be less confusing if the converter
used ''new int'' instead of ''newInt'' here.

== Value properties on the ''int'' class object ==

=== MAX_VALUE ===

<P> The value of ''MAX_VALUE'' is the largest positive integer value
represented by the ''int'' class.  Its value is 2<SUP>31</SUP>-1.

=== MIN_VALUE ===

<P> The value of ''MIN_VALUE'' is the smallest negative value
represented by the ''int'' class.  Its value is -2<SUP>31</SUP>.

<FIXME> (Ticket #182.)  int.MIN_VALUE is not symmetric with
Number.MIN_VALUE, as the latter holds the smallest //positive// value
represented by a double.  Ditto, uint.MIN_VALUE is 0 (a bit silly) and
decimal.MIN_VALUE will be a positive value as for double.

<P class="fixme"> It's not clear to me that the asymmetry is a problem,
though.


== Methods on ''int'' instances ==

=== intrinsic::toString ( radix=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts this integer value
to a string representation in a base given by //radix//.

<P> If radix is the number 10 or undefined, then the result is as for
the ''ToString'' operator.

<P> If radix is an integer from 2 to 36, but not 10, the result is an
implementation-dependent string

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toString'' method returns a ''string''.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="int.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

=== intrinsic::toLocaleString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toLocaleString'' method converts this integer
value to a string value that represents the value of the integer
formatted according to the conventions of the host environment's
current locale.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toLocaleString'' method returns an
implementation-dependent string.

<IMPL> The intrinsic ''toLocaleString'' method is
implementation-dependent, and it is permissible, but not encouraged,
for it to return the same thing as the intrinsic ''toString'' method.

<NOTE> The first parameter to this function is likely to be used in a
future version of this standard; it is recommended that
implementations do not use this parameter position for anything else.


=== intrinsic::valueOf ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns the integer value
represented by this ''int'' object: the object itself.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''valueOf'' method returns its ''this'' object.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="int.es" name="override intrinsic function valueOf">


=== intrinsic::toFixed ( fractionDigits=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toFixed'' method converts the this number value
to a string in fixed-point notation with //fractionDigits// digits
after the decimal point.  If //fractionDigits// is **undefined**, 0
is assumed.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toFixed'' method returns the fixed-point
notation string representation of this number value.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="int.es" name="intrinsic function toFixed">


=== intrinsic::toExponential ( fractionDigits=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toExponential'' method converts this number value
to a string in exponential notation with one digit before the
significand's decimal point and //fractionDigits// digits after the
significand's decimal point.  If //fractionDigits// is **undefined**,
include as many significand digits as necessary to uniquely specify
the number (just like in ''ToString'' except that in this case the
number is always output in exponential notation).

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toExponential'' method returns the exponential
notation string representation of this number value.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="int.es" name="intrinsic function toExponential">

=== intrinsic::toPrecision ( precision=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toPrecision'' method converts this number value
to a string, either in exponential notation with one digit before the
significand's decimal point and //precision//-1 digits after the
significand's decimal point or in fixed notation with //precision//
significant digits.  If precision is **undefined**, call ''ToString''
(<XREF target="Operator:ToString">) instead.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toPrecision'' method returns the selected string
representation of this number value.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="int.es" name="intrinsic function toPrecision">
