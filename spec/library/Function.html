CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 3 (LAST CALL - 2008-03-20)

  * Prototype methods are explicitly designated 'public' because the
    language requires it


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 2 (2008-03-14)

  * The 'thisObj' parameter of 'bind' may be null (it still has to be
    provided explicitly), since there's no particular reason to restrict
    bind from working against the global object.


CHANGES SINCE DRAFT 1 (2008-03-10)

  * The 'thisObj' parameter to 'bind' is no longer optional, it must
    be an object (not null).

  * Removed the "Implementation" section for the 'meta::invoke' method
    (it added nothing).

  * Replaced note about host functions being "anything" with a
    paragraph about the type 'Callable'.


NOTES

  * The use of 'Private' instead of 'private' below is a workaround
    for a bug in the reference implementation (#368).

<P> The class ''Function'' is a dynamic, non-final, direct subclass of
''Object'' (see <XREF target="class Object">).

<P> All objects defined by ''function'' definitions or expressions in
ECMAScript are instances of the class ''Function''.

<P> Not all objects that can be called as functions are instances of
subclasses of the ''Function'' class, however.  Any object that has a
''meta::invoke'' property can be called as a function.

<P> The structural type ''Callable'' (see <XREF target="type:Callable">) 
matches every object that has a ''meta::invoke'' property.


== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Function'' provides the following interface:

{{{
dynamic class Function extends Object
{
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="public function Function">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="static meta function invoke">

    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="static public function apply">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="static public function bind">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="static public function call">

    static public const length = 1

    meta final function invoke( <LDOTS> ) <LDOTS>

    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function apply">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function bind">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function call">

    public const length = <LDOTS>
    public var   prototype = <LDOTS>
}
}}}

<p>The ''Function'' prototype object provides these direct properties:

{{{
    meta::invoke: function () <LDOTS>
    length:       0
    toString:     function () <LDOTS>
    apply:        function(thisArg, argArray) <LDOTS>
    bind:         function(thisArg, ...args) <LDOTS>
    call:         function(thisArg, ...args) <LDOTS>
}}}


== Methods on the ''Function'' class object ==

<H3 id="Function: constructor"> new Function (p1, p2, <LDOTS> , pn, body) </h3>

<DESC> When the ''Function'' constructor is called with some arguments
as part of a ''new'' expression, it creates a new ''Function''
instance whose parameter list is given by the concatenation of the
//p<SUB>i</SUB>// arguments separated by "," and whose executable code
is given by the //body// argument.

<P> There may be no //p<SUB>i</SUB>// arguments, and //body// is optional too,
defaulting to the empty string.

<p> If the first character of the comma-separated concatenation of the
//p<SUB>i</SUB>// is a left parenthesis then the list of parameters
must be parseable as a //FormalParameterList<sub>opt</sub>// enclosed
in parentheses and optionally followed by a colon and a return type.

<p> Otherwise, the list of parameters must be parsable as a
//FormalParameterList<sub>opt</sub>//.

<p> If the list of parameters is not parseable as outlined in the
previous two paragraphs, or if the body is not parsable as a
//FunctionBody//, then a **SyntaxError** exception is thrown (see the
grammar in section <XREF target="ECMAScript grammar">).

<P> Regardless of the form of the parameter list, it may include type
annotations, default parameter values, and rest arguments.

<RETN> The ''Function'' constructor returns a new ''Function'' instance.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="public function Function">
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="helper function createFunction">

<p> The magic function ''initializeFunction'' initializes the function
object ''this'' from the list of parameters and the body, as specified
in section <XREF target="translation:FunctionExpression">.  The global
object is passed in as the scope parameter.

<p>A ''prototype'' object is automatically created for every function,
to provide for the possibility that the function will be used as a
constructor.

<NOTE> It is permissible but not necessary to have one argument for
each formal parameter to be specified. For example, all three of the
following expressions produce the same result:

{{{
new Function("a", "b", "c", "return a+b+c")

new Function("a, b, c", "return a+b+c")

new Function("a,b", "c", "return a+b+c")
}}}


<h3 id="Function: static meta invoke"> Function (p1, p2, <LDOTS> , pn, body) </h3>

<DESC> When the ''Function'' class object is called as a function it
creates and initialises a new ''Function'' object.  Thus the function
call ''Function(<LDOTS>)'' is equivalent to the object creation
expression ''new Function(<LDOTS>)'' with the same arguments.

<RETN> The ''Function'' class object called as a function returns a
new ''Function'' instance.

<SHORTIMPL>
<!-- Faking it until we get the RI right -->
{{{
meta static function invoke(...args)
    new Function(...args);
}}}

<FIXME> Ticket #357: That particular definition makes use of the
prefix "spread" operator, which has not yet been formally accepted
into the language.

=== apply ( fn, thisArg=<LDOTS>, argArray=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''apply'' method takes arguments //fn//,
//thisArg//, and //argArray// and invokes //fn// in the standard
manner, passing //thisArg// as the value for ''this'' and the members
of //argArray// as the individual argument values.

<RETN> The ''apply'' method returns the value returned by //fn//.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="static public function apply">

<NOTE> The magic ''apply'' function performs the actual invocation (see
<XREF target="magic::apply">).  This code will eventually change to
use the prefix "spread" operator.



=== bind ( fn, thisArg=<LDOTS>, ...args ) ===

<DESC> The static ''bind'' method takes arguments //fn//, //thisArg//,
and optionally some //args//.

<RETN> The ''bind'' method returns a ''Function'' object that accepts
some arguments //moreargs// and which calls //fn// with //thisArg// as
the ''this'' object and the values of //args// and //moreargs// as
actual arguments.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="static public function bind">
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="static helper function bind">


=== call ( fn, thisArg=<LDOTS>, ...args ) ===

<DESC> The static ''call'' method takes arguments //fn// and
//thisArg// and optionally some //args// and invokes //fn// in the
standard manner, passing //thisArg// as the value for ''this'' and the
members of //args// as the individual argument values.

<RETN> The ''call'' method returns the value returned by //fn//.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="static public function call">



== Methods on Function instances ==

=== meta::invoke ( <LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The meta method ''invoke'' is specialized to the individual
''Function'' object.  When called, it evaluates the executable code
for the function.

<P> The meta method ''invoke'' is typically called by the ECMAScript
implementation as part of the function invocation and object
construction protocols.  When a function or method is invoked, the
''invoke'' method of the function or method object provides the code
to run.  When a function is used to construct a new object, the
''invoke'' method provides the code for the constructor function.

<P> The signature of the meta method ''invoke'' is determined when the
''Function'' instance is created, and is determined by the text that
defines the function being created.

<NOTE> The meta method ''invoke'' is ''final''; therefore subclasses
can add properties and methods but can't override the function calling
behavior.

<FIXME> (Ticket #173.)  While it is necessary that the ''invoke''
method is completely magic in ''Function'' instances, it's not clear
that it needs to be magic for instances of subclasses of ''Function'',
because these can be treated like other objects that have ''invoke''
methods (and which already work just fine in the reference
implementation).  Therefore it should not be ''final''.

<RETN> The meta method ''invoke'' returns the value produces by the
first ''return'' statement that is evaluated during the evaluation of
the executable code for the function represented by this ''Function''
object.

=== intrinsic::toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts the executable code
of the function to a string representation.  This representation has
the syntax of a //FunctionDeclaration// or //FunctionExpression//.
Note in particular that the use and placement of white space, line
terminators, and semicolons within the representation string is
implementation-dependent.

<COMP>ES3 required the syntax to be that of a //FunctionDeclaration//
only, but that made it impossible to produce a string representation
for functions created from unnamed function expressions.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toString'' method returns a string.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

<P> The private function ''toString'' is implementation-dependent.


=== intrinsic::apply ( thisObj=<LDOTS>, args=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''apply'' method calls the static ''apply'' method
with the value of ''this'' as the first argument.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''apply'' method returns the result of the static
''apply'' method.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function apply">


=== intrinsic::bind ( thisObj=<LDOTS>, ...args) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''bind'' method calls the static ''bind'' method
with the value of ''this'' as the first argument.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''bind'' method returns the result of the static
''bind'' method.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function bind">


=== intrinsic::call ( thisObj=<LDOTS>, ...args) ===

<DESC>The intrinsic ''call'' method calls the static ''apply'' method
with the value of ''this'' as the first argument.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''call'' method returns the result of the static
''call'' method.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function call">


== Value properties of ''Function'' instances ==

=== length ===

<P> The value of the constant ''length'' property is the number of
non-rest arguments accepted by the function.

<P> The value of the ''length'' property is an integer that indicates
the "typical" number of arguments expected by the function.  However,
the language permits the function to be invoked with some other number
of arguments.  The behaviour of a function when invoked on a number of
arguments other than the number specified by its length property
depends on the function.


=== prototype ===

<P> The initial value of the ''prototype'' property is a fresh
''Object'' instance.

<P> The value of the ''prototype'' property is used to initialise the
internal [[Prototype]] property of a newly created object before the
''Function'' instance is invoked as a constructor for that newly
created object.


== Invoking the ''Function'' prototype object ==

<P> When the ''Function'' prototype object is invoked it accepts any
arguments and returns **undefined**:

<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="public prototype meta function invoke">


== Methods on the ''Function'' prototype object ==

<p> The methods on the ''Function'' prototype object perform simple
type adjustments and then perform the same actions as their intrinsic
counterparts:

<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="public prototype function toString">
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="public prototype function apply">
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="public prototype function bind">
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="public prototype function call">


== Value properties on the ''Function'' prototype object ==

=== length === 

<P> The initial value of the ''length'' prototype property is 0.

<IMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="public prototype var length">

<COMP> The "length" property of the prototype is not obviously
required by the 3rd Edition of this Standard, but MSIE, Firefox,
Opera, and Safari all provide it.
