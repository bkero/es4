<P> The class ''Function'' is a dynamic non-final subclass of
''Object'' (see <XREF target="class Object">).

<P> All objects defined by ''function'' definitions or expressions in
ECMAScript are instances of the class ''Function''.

<P> Not all objects that can be called as functions are instances of
subclasses of the ''Function'' class, however.  Any object that has a
''meta invoke'' method can be called as a function.

<NOTE> Host functions may also not be instances of ''Function'' or its
subclasses, but must to some extent behave as if they are (see <XREF
target="Host objects">).


== Synopsis ==

<P> The class ''Function'' provides the following interface:

{{{
dynamic class Function extends Object
{
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="function Function">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="meta static function invoke">

    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="static function apply">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="static function call">

    static const length = 1

    meta final function invoke( <LDOTS> ) <LDOTS>

    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="override intrinsic function toString">

    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function apply">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function call">
    <SIGNATURE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function HasInstance">

    const length = <LDOTS>
    var   prototype = <LDOTS>
}
}}}

<p>The ''Function'' prototype object provides these direct properties:

{{{
    toString:    function () <LDOTS> ,
    apply:       function(thisArg, argArray) <LDOTS> ,
    call:        function(thisArg, ...args) <LDOTS> ,
}}}


== Methods on the ''Function'' class object ==

<H3 id="Function: constructor"> new Function (p1, p2, <LDOTS> , pn, body) </h3>

<DESC> When the ''Function'' constructor is called with some arguments as
part of a ''new'' expression, it creates a new ''Function'' instance
whose parameter list is given by the concatenation of the //p<SUB>i</SUB>//
arguments and whose executable code is given by the //body// argument.

<P> There may be no //p<SUB>i</SUB>// arguments, and //body// is optional too,
defaulting to the empty string.

<p> If the list of parameters is not parsable as a
//FormalParameterList<sub>opt</sub>//, or if the body is not parsable
as a //FunctionBody//, then a **SyntaxError** exception is thrown (see
the grammar in section <XREF target="ECMAScript grammar">).

<RETN> The ''Function'' constructor returns a new ''Function'' instance.

<SHORTIMPL>

<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="function Function">
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="helper function createFunction">

<P> The helper function ''createFunction'' is also used by the
''invoke'' method (see <XREF target="Function: meta static invoke">).

<p> The magic function ''initializeFunction'' initializes the function
object ''this'' from the list of parameters and the body, as specified
in section <XREF target="translation:FunctionExpression">.  The global
object is passed in as the Scope parameter.

<p>A ''prototype'' property is automatically created for every function, to
provide for the possibility that the function will be used as a
constructor.

<NOTE> It is permissible but not necessary to have one argument for
each formal parameter to be specified. For example, all three of the
following expressions produce the same result:

{{{
new Function("a", "b", "c", "return a+b+c")

new Function("a, b, c", "return a+b+c")

new Function("a,b", "c", "return a+b+c")
}}}

<FIXME> (Ticket #172.)  Type annotations?  The RI barfs (looks like an
incomplete or incorrect set of namespaces is provided during
construction).

<p class="fixme"> Return type annotations?  No way to specify this using the
current shape of the constructor.

<p class="fixme"> Default values?  The RI says yes.

<p class="fixme"> Rest arguments?  The RI says yes.

<p class="fixme"> One possibility is to extend the syntax, s.t. the
//p<SUB>i</SUB>// concatenated can form a syntactically valid
parameter list bracketed by ''('' and '')''; this creates the
possibility that a return type annotation can follow the '')''.


<h3 id="Function: meta static invoke"> Function (p1, p2, <LDOTS> , pn, body) </h3>

<DESC> When the ''Function'' class object is called as a function it
creates and initialises a new ''Function'' object.  Thus the function
call ''Function(<LDOTS>)'' is equivalent to the object creation
expression ''new Function(<LDOTS>)'' with the same arguments.

<RETN> The ''Function'' class object called as a function returns a
new ''Function'' instance.

<SHORTIMPL>

<!-- Faking it until we get the RI right -->
{{{
meta static function invoke(...args)
    helper::createFunction(args)
}}}

<P> The helper function ''createFunction'' was defined along with the
''Function'' constructor (see <XREF target="Function: constructor">).


=== apply ( fn, thisArg=<LDOTS>, argArray=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The static ''apply'' method takes arguments //fn//, //thisArg//, and
//argArray//, and performs a function call using the [[Call]] property
of //fn//, passing //thisArg// as the value for ''this'' and the
members of //argArray// as the individual argument values.

<p> If //fn// does not have a [[Call]] property, a **TypeError**
exception is thrown.

<RETN> The ''apply'' method returns the value returned by //fn//.

<SHORTIMPL>

<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="static function apply">

<p> The magic ''apply'' function performs the actual invocation (see
<XREF target="magic::apply">).


=== call ( fn, thisArg=<LDOTS>, ...args ) ===

<DESC> The static ''call'' method takes arguments //fn// and //thisArg// and
optionally some //args//, and performs a function call using the
[[Call]] property of //fn//, passing //thisArg// as the value for ''this''
and the members of //args// as the individual argument values.

<P> If //fn// does not have a [[Call]] property, a **TypeError** exception
is thrown.

<RETN> The ''call'' method returns the value returned by //fn//.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="static function call">


== Methods on Function instances ==

=== meta::invoke ( <LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The meta method ''invoke'' is specialized to the individual
function object.  When called, it evaluates the executable code for
the function.

<P> The meta method ''invoke'' is typically called by the ECMAScript
implementation as part of the function invocation and object
construction protocols.  When a function or method is invoked, the
''invoke'' method of the function or method object provides the code
to run.  When a function is used to construct a new object, the
''invoke'' method provides the code for the constructor function.

<P> The signature of the meta method ''invoke'' is determined when the
''Function'' instance is created, and is determined by the text that
defines the function being created.

<NOTE> The meta method ''invoke'' is ''final''; therefore subclasses
can add properties and methods but can't override the function calling
behavior.

<FIXME> (Ticket #173.)  While it is necessary that the ''invoke''
method is completely magic in ''Function'' instances, it's not clear
it needs to be magic for instances of subclasses of ''Function'',
because these can be treated like other objects that have ''invoke''
methods (and which already work just fine).  Therefore it should not
be ''final''.

<RETN> The meta method ''invoke'' returns the result of evaluating the
executable code for the function represented by this ''Function''
object.


=== intrinsic::toString ( ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''toString'' method converts the executable code
of the function to a string representation.  This representation has
the syntax of a //FunctionDeclaration//.  Note in particular that the
use and placement of white space, line terminators, and semicolons
within the representation string is implementation-dependent.

<FIXME> (Ticket #174.) It doesn't make a lot of sense for (function ()
{}).toString() to return something that looks like a
//FunctionDeclaration//, since the function has no name, so we might
at least specify what is produced in that case.  FF, Opera, and Safari
print the above without printing any function name.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''toString'' method returns a string.

<SHORTIMPL>
{{{
intrinsic function toString(): string
    informative::source;
}}}

<p> The informative property ''source'' holds a string representation
of this function object.


=== intrinsic::apply ( thisObj=<LDOTS>, args=<LDOTS> ) ===

<DESC> The intrinsic ''apply'' method calls the static ''apply'' method
with the current value of ''this'' as the first argument.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''apply'' method returns the result of the static
''apply'' method.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function apply">

=== intrinsic::call ( thisObj=<LDOTS>, ...args) ===

<DESC>The intrinsic ''call'' method calls the static ''apply'' method
with the current value of ''this'' as the first argument.

<RETN> The intrinsic ''call'' method returns the result of the static
''call'' method.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function call">


<!--
=== %%[[HasInstance]]%% (V) ===

<FIXME> Is this what we want?

<DESC>The [[HasInstance]] method of a ''Function'' object called with
a value //V// determines if //V// is an instance of the ''Function'' object.

<RETN> A boolean value.

<SHORTIMPL>
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="intrinsic function HasInstance">

<p> The magic ''getPrototype'' function extracts the [[Prototype]] property
from the object (see <XREF target="magic:getPrototype">).
-->


== Properties of ''Function'' instances ==

<p> In addition to the required internal properties, every function
instance has a [[Call]] property, a [[Construct]] property and a
[[Scope]] property (see sections 8.6.2 and 13.2).


=== length ===

<P> The value of the constant ''length'' property is the number of
non-rest arguments accepted by the function.

<P> The value of the ''length'' property is an integer that indicates
the "typical" number of arguments expected by the function.  However,
the language permits the function to be invoked with some other number
of arguments.  The behaviour of a function when invoked on a number of
arguments other than the number specified by its length property
depends on the function.

=== prototype ===

<P> The initial value of the ''prototype'' property is a fresh
''Object'' instance.

<P> The value of the ''prototype'' property is used to initialise the
internal [[Prototype]] property of a newly created object before the
''Function'' instance is invoked as a constructor for that newly
created object.

== Invoking the ''Function'' prototype object ==

<P> When the ''Function'' prototype object is invoked it accepts any
arguments and returns **undefined**:

<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="meta prototype function invoke">


== Methods on the ''Function'' prototype object ==

<p> The methods on the ''Function'' prototype object call their
intrinsic counterparts:

<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="prototype function toString">
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="prototype function apply">
<INCLUDE file="Function.es" name="prototype function call">

<p> The Function prototype object does not have a ''valueOf'' property
of its own; however, it inherits the ''valueOf'' property from the
''Object'' prototype object.
